## <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Government of Ghana</span> convenes National Landscape Forum on Natural Resource Management and Forest Economy for inclusive and sustainable growth

The Government of Ghana (GoG), with support from the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">World Bank</span>, has organized a 3-day National Landscape Forum, a programme which aimed to bring together <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">professionals</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">interested persons</span> from  public,  private  and  non-governmental  agencies  working  in  the  areas  of  natural  resources management (NRM) and environmental sustainability in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Ghana</span>, The forum showcased project results, facilitated  dialogue in  specific  areas  of  concern, discussed  opportunities for  synergies  across  NRM sectors to achieve stronger impacts, as well as pathways towards harnessing forest-based economy for sustainable economic prosperity.

Currently,  the  main  environmental  challenges  in  <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Ghana</span>  include  deforestation,  land  and  landscape degradation, pollution, coastal degradation, and depletion of fish stocks, with the country&#x27;s economic and  human  development  also  vulnerable  to  climate  change  and  climate-related  shocks.  The  <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">GoG</span>, however, has rolled out several programs to support the sustainable management of its natural resources and  environmental  restoration,  which  have  been  supported  by  the  <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">World  Bank</span>  through  several investment projects, technical assistance, and a carbon finance programme.

Good  resource  management  should  be  based  on  data.  The  <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Natural  Capital  Accounting  (NCA) programme</span>, with support from the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">World Bank&#x27;s Global Program on Sustainability</span>, has supported the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#FCE4EC;">Government</span> in developing the land accounts, the ecosystem extent accounts, and the ecosystem services accounts, using the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA</span>). These accounts present changes in land and ecosystem cover and provide physical and monetary value estimates for some of the  ecosystem  services.  Data  from  these  accounts  has  already  been  used  to  develop  guidelines  for mainstreaming biodiversity into national development planning and to further analyze nexus between poverty and natural capital.

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Ghana</span> has a lot to showcase in terms of inclusive and sustainable natural resources management. Ghana is  one  of  the  <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Africa</span>  champions  on  <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Reducing  Emission  from  Deforestation  and  Forest  Degradation (REDD</span>+), as well as one of the first countries globally to receive <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">carbon payments</span> from the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">World Bank</span> for emissions reductions generated in the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">cocoa forest mosaic landscape</span> through propagation of the shaded cocoa systems. Additionally, Ghana&#x27;s integrated landscape management approaches have been piloted by the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology (MEST)</span> and the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources (MLNR)</span> under the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Ghana Sustainable Land and Water Management Project</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Forest Investment Program (FIP</span>). These flagship projects helped consolidate implementation  experience  related  to  integrated  and  participatory  landscape  management,  support policy reforms and institutional strengthening in the forestry sector, and pilot many new approaches to sustainable land and water management (SLWM) and community management of natural resources, creation  of  the  community-based  governance  structures  for  forest  management,  and  community engagement and empowerment, including scale up of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">CREMAs</span> in the cocoa forest landscape. These investments have reached over 130,000 beneficiaries with knowledge and inputs related to adoption of

## Press Release

SLWM, sustainable forest management practices and developed significant SLWM extension capacity in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Northern Ghana</span>, the most climate sensitive and poorest part of the country.

The <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Government of Ghana</span> has capitalized on previous successes to advance sustainable landscape and forest  management  practices  within  the  <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Northern  Savannah  Zone</span>  and  <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Cocoa  Forest  Landscape</span>. Supported by the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">World Bank</span> through investments, technical assistance, and analytics, the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">Government of Ghana</span> is implementing several initiatives in the natural resources sector aimed at achieving inclusive and  sustainable  growth.  These  initiatives  include  reforming  policies  and  institutions,  strengthening community-based governance structures for forest management, promoting environmentally sustainable  cocoa  production,  providing  additional  livelihoods  for  forest  and  rural  communities, supporting efforts to formalize small-scale mining, and support mercury-free practices. Additionally, the  <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">government</span>  is  enhancing  coastal  community  resilience  against  erosion,  flooding,  and  pollution across multiple districts. By leveraging its investments in forests, the government has secured resultbased carbon payments amounting to over <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">20 million dollars</span>, with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#EADDFF;">60%</span> of the benefits allocated to forest communities.

The  <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">3-day</span>  forum  officially  launched  and  presented  the  results  for  the  Natural  Capital  Accounts developed under the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">NCA programme</span>, discussed key issues in current projects, with expected outcomes of increased intersectoral understanding of existing challenges and enhanced capacity to plan for future interventions.
