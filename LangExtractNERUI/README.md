#  Financial Document Analysis AI

A powerful full-stack application designed to extract, analyze, and visualize information from financial documents. This tool leverages a suite of advanced AI libraries to process both digital and scanned PDFs, providing structured data and insights through a clean, modern user interface.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Advanced Document Parsing:** Utilizes the `docling` library to handle both digital and scanned PDFs, with OCR capabilities for image-based documents.
* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Employs a custom-trained `spaCy` model (`best_finance_ner_model`) to identify and extract key financial entities.
* **Prompt-Based Extraction:** Integrates `langextract` to perform targeted, few-shot extraction based on user-defined prompts and examples.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** Renders extracted entities from both SpaCy and LangExtract in a clear, easy-to-read HTML format.
* **Full-Stack Architecture:** Built with a robust Flask backend for AI processing and a responsive React frontend for a seamless user experience.
