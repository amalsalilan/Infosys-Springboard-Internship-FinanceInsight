        ## INTRODUCTION TO <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">FINANCE</span>

In general, finance is defined as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the provision of money at the tim It is required.</span>

Specifically it is defined as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">procurement of funds and their effective utilisation.</span>

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Financial management</span> is defined as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the management of flow of funds in a firm.</span>

All business decisions have financial implications and therefore <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">financial management</span> is inevitably related with every aspect of business operations.

## EVOLUTION OF FINANCE

It may be divided into three broad categories, i.e., traditional phase, transitional phase and modern phase.

- 1.<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">The Traditional Phase (Up to 1940)</span> Initially finance was a part of economic activities and business

owners were more concerned with the operational activities.

Characteristics of this phase were :

- -finance function was episodic in nature.
- -funds were arranged mainly from financial institutions or through shares/ debentures.
- -the outsider&#x27;s point of view was dominant

## 2.<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">Transitional Phase (1940 -1950)</span>

Here though the nature of financial management was similar to traditional phase but greater emphasis was placed on day-to-day activities.

Funds analysis and control on a regular basis, rather than on a casual basis.

## 3.<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">The Modern Phase (After 1950)</span>

Started since mid 1950&#x27;s.

Rapid growth of business and competition increases the day-to-day activities. importanceof finance not only for episodic events but also for

The <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">finance manager</span> has emerged as a professional manager involved with fundsto beraised by thefirm, withtheallocation of these funds to different projects and with the measurement of the result of each allocation.

Major characteristics of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">modern phase</span> are :

- -the firm (i.e., insider) is more important
- -rational matching of funds to their uses so as to maximise the wealth of the current shareholders.

-the approach has become more analytical and quantitative

.

## FINANCIAL DECISIONS IN A FIRM

The decisions of raising funds investing them in assets and distributing returns earned from assets to shareholders are respectively known as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">financing decision</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">investment decisions</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">dividend decision</span>.
