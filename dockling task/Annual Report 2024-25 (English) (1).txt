## 1. Department of Economic Affairs

## Economic Growth

The global economy demonstrated resilience in 2024 despite  challenges  posed  by  evolving  geopolitical dynamics. The International Monetary Fund, has projected growth of 3.2 per cent and 3.3 per cent for 2024 and 2025, respectively.  While the overall outlook remains stable, regional  variations  in  growth  trajectories  are  evident. Inflation rates globally have converged, pointing to a decline in  global  inflation  rates.  Global  headline  inflation  is projected to fall from an annual average of 6.7 per cent in 2023 to 5.7 per cent in 2024 and further to 4.2 per cent in 2025, with advanced economies nearing their inflation targets sooner than emerging and developing economies. Sudden eruptions in financial market volatility could tighten financial conditions and weigh on investment and growth. Further  disruptions  to  the  disinflation  process  could potentially be triggered by new spikes in commodity prices amid  persistent  geopolitical  tensions.  Against  this backdrop,  India  continues  to  demonstrate  a  resilient economic performance, reaffirming its position as the fastest-growing  major  economy,  driven  by  strong macroeconomic fundamentals and a promising outlook.

As per the first advance estimates released by the National  Statistical  Office,  Ministry  of  Statistics  &amp; Programme Implementation, the real GDP growth for 202425 is estimated to be 6.4 per cent. The real GVA growth is also estimated to be 6.4 per cent. Among the sub-sectors in  the  economy,  construction, utility  services  such  as electricity,  gas,  water  supply  &amp;  other  utility  services, finance,  real  estate  &amp;  professional  services,  public administration, defence &amp; other services are estimated to

Introduction catalyse the growth. From the angle of aggregate demand in the economy, private final consumption expenditure at constant prices is estimated to grow by 7.3 per cent, driven by a rebound in rural demand. PFCE as a share of GDP (at current prices) is estimated to increase from 60.3 per cent in 2023-24 to 61.8 per cent in 2024-25. This share is the highest since 2002-03. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) (at constant prices) is estimated to grow by 6.4 per cent.

On the external side, India's total exports have also shown positive momentum in the first nine months of FY25, witnessing a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 6.03 1  per cent. India's total imports during  April-December 2024 registered a YoY growth of 6.91 per cent. The faster pace of increase in merchandise imports compared to exports contributed to the widening of the merchandise trade deficit. However, rising  net  service  receipts  continued  to  support improvement in the current account balance.

## Performance of the Agriculture sector

The Indian agriculture sector grew by 1.4 per cent in 2023-24. Agriculture and the allied sector grew by 3.5 per cent in the Q2 of FY25. The total food grain production during 2023-24 is estimated at a record 3323 Lakh Tonne (LT), which is higher by 26 LT than the production of food grains achieved during 2022-23. A record increase foodgrain production is due to higher production of rice, wheat and shree anna. Total rice production was higher by 20.7 LT in 2023-24 than 2022-23, while wheat production is higher by 27.4 LT than the previous year. The production of shree anna is estimated at 176 LT in 2023-24 as compared to 173 LT in 2022-23. Further, the total pulses production during 2023-24 is estimated at 243 LT and total oilseeds production is estimated at 397 LT.

## Monetary developments

During FY25 (April-December 2024), the MPC has decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent.  Until  its  August  2024  meeting,  the  committee retained its stance on withdrawing  accommodation to ensure inflation aligns with the target while supporting growth. Considering the prevailing and expected inflationgrowth dynamics, i.e., resilient domestic growth outlook, better prospects for rabi and kharif crops, and availability of ample buffer stocks of foodgrains, the committee in its October 2024 MPC decided to change the monetary policy stance from the withdrawal of accommodation to 'neutral'. In its December 2024 meeting, taking note of the recent growth momentum slowdown, it revised its growth forecast for FY25 to 6.6 per cent from an earlier forecast of 7.2 per cent.  Driven  by  a  rise  in  inflation  in  October  2024 (surpassing  the  RBI's  upper  tolerance  limit)  and  the expectations of high food inflation pressures to persist in

Q3 of FY25, the MPC has raised the inflation forecast for FY25 to 4.8 per cent from an earlier forecast of 4.5 percent.

## Developments in capital markets

Capital markets are central to India's growth story, catalysing  capital  formation  for  the  real  economy, enhancing the financialisation of domestic savings, and enabling wealth creation. As of December 2024, the Indian stock market has achieved new highs, with intermittent corrections,  in  the  midst  of  geopolitical  uncertainties, currency  depreciation  and  domestic  market  volatility challenges. Investor participation has been a contributor, with number of investors growing from 4.9 crore in FY20 to  13.2  crore  as  of  31  December  2024.  This  growth, combined with active listing activity and recent measures by the regulator, viz. Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), to temper excesses, is expected to foster sustainable market expansion.

The total resource mobilisation from primary markets (equity and debt) stands at ` 11.1 lakh crore from April to December 2024, which is 5 per cent more than the amount mobilised during entire FY24. This also amounts to 25.6 per cent of gross fixed capital formation of private and public corporations during FY24. The number of IPOs increased by 32.1 per cent to 259 during April to December 2024 from 196 in the corresponding period of the previous year, while the amount raised almost tripled from ` 53,023 crore to ` 1,53,987 crore in the same period. The mainboard platform witnessed a significant increase in issue size as the average IPO deal size rose to ` 2,124 crore, up from ` 814 crore in entire FY24. In the case of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) IPOs, the average deal size increased to ` 39 crore  from ` 31 crore  during  the  same  period. Reflecting  the  buoyant  market  conditions,  Qualified Institutional Players (QIPs) emerged as the preferred equity fundraising mechanism for the corporates during FY25, with a 11.4 per cent share in total capital raised. Resource mobilisation through rights issues remains buoyant, with ` 16,881  crore  raised  during April  to  December  2024, compared to ` 6,538 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.

Since  the  commencement  of  FY25,  they  have experienced significant volatility driven by various events. These include the general elections in June 2024, the unwinding of carry trades in Japan in August 2024, the escalation of conflict in the Middle  East and the U.S. Presidential Election (November 2024). Notwithstanding the  intermittent  corrections,  the  markets  showed  a consistent upward trend until September 2024, scaling new all-time highs. Strong domestic economic prospects, robust  domestic  institutional  investor  inflows,  foreign portfolio investments, anticipated policy pivots from major central banks, etc., drove the uptrend. However, this trend has moderated since October 2024, driven by economic stimulus measures in China, the US Presidential elections

and valuation concerns. On account of recent corrections, the benchmark index, Nifty 50, delivered a return (in local currency) of 4.6 per cent return from April to December 2024. The highest returns (in USD) were delivered by Hong Kong's Hang Seng (22.2 per cent), followed by Nasdaq Composite (17.9 per cent), Singapore FTSE Straits Times (16.2 per cent) and South Africa's FTSE/JSE All Share index (13.3 per cent) during the same period.

The period since the pandemic has seen a surge in individual and household participation as capital market investors through direct (trading in markets through their accounts) and indirect (through mutual funds) channels. Healthy corporate earnings, stable macro fundamentals, efficient and robust technology architecture facilitating efficient trading, clearing, and depository systems, and trust garnered by mutual fund ecosystem and online digital investment platforms have encouraged greater participation in  capital markets. The incremental addition to demat accounts  has  been  continuously  increasing,  with  the number of demat accounts rising sharply by 33 per cent to 18.5 crore at the end of December 2024 on a YoY basis. In  the  equity  cash segment, individual  investor share turnover 2   was 35.6 per cent from April to December 2024. There are 11.5 crore unique investors with demat accounts and 5.6 crore unique investors in mutual funds as of the end of December 2024. Higher investor participation has engendered a self-reinforcing  cycle  of  strong  market returns, bringing in even more investors. This, in turn, will eventually transform the securities market into a more diverse, inclusive, and robust platform for wealth creation.

The mutual fund industry has grown well in the last few years and is now crucial in channelling financial savings towards risk capital formation and leveraging technology and innovation. The rise in retail participation through mutual funds is reflected in the doubling of unique investors from 2.9 crore in FY21 to 5.6 crore as of December 2024. The  total  number  of  folios  (excluding  FoF  domestic schemes) increased from 17.8 crore at the end of FY24 to 22.5 crore at the end of December 2024, and retail investors 3   held mutual fund units worth ` 18.6 lakh crore. This surge in participation, coupled with strong market performance, has led to a remarkable increase in mutual funds' assets under management, which rose to ` 66.9 lakh crore as of December 2024, registering 25.3 per cent growth from March  2024.  The  mutual fund segment presently has more than 10 crore Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) accounts, with cumulative SIP inflows of ` 10.9 lakh crore since inception. Monthly average gross SIP flows have more than doubled in the last three years, from ` 0.10 lakh crore in FY22 to ` 0.23 lakh crore in FY25. Aided by these sustained inflows, mutual fund ownership in Indian listed companies has risen to a fresh all-time high of 9.5 per cent 4   in the quarter ending September 2024, from 8.7 per cent in FY24.

## Liquidity conditions and its management

Examining the trend in various measures of money supply in the economy, viz., different aggregates that reflect varying degrees of liquidity, it is seen that the monetary base, viz. the most liquid form of money, M0, recorded a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 3.6 per cent as of 3 January 2025, compared to 6.3 per cent a year ago. The growth in M3, excluding the impact of the merger of a non-bank with a bank (with effect from 1 July 2023), was 9.3 per cent (YoY) as of 27 December 2024, compared to 11 per cent a year ago. Component-wise 5  , aggregate deposits were the most significant component and contributed most to the expansion of M3. Amongst sources 6  , bank credit to the commercial sector was a major contributor to the increase in M 3 . As of 27 December 2024, MM 7 , i.e., the ratio of M 3 to  M 0 ,  stood at 5.7 against 5.5 a year ago. Adjusted for reverse repo amounts, analytically akin to banks' deposits with the central bank, the adjusted MM was lower at 5.6 as of 27 December 2024.

## Performance of the Banking sector

The GNPA ratio of SCBs has declined consistently from its peak in FY18 to a 12-year low of 2.6 per cent at the  end  of  September  2024.  Lower  slippages  and  a reduction  in  outstanding  GNPAs  through  recoveries, upgradations, and write-offs have led to this decrease. Lower GNPAs and higher provisions accumulated in recent years also contributed to a decline in net NPAs at around 0.6 per cent at the end of September 2024. Improvements in asset quality parameters were observed across all major bank groups.

7 The money multiplier measures the maximum amount of money that a banking system generates with each unit of central bank money.

The restructured standard advances (RSA) ratio, which is the share of RSA in total gross loans and advances, for SCBs declined from 1.8 per cent at the end of March 2022 to 0.7 per cent at the end of September 2024. All major bank groups reported a decrease in this ratio. The CRAR of SCBs has increased in the post-asset quality review period, which was conducted from August to November 2015. For FY24, around 93 per cent of the increase in the capital funds was contributed by the rise in Tier-I capital of banks, indicative of the robustness of capital buffers.  At the end of September 2024, the CRAR of SCBs stood at 16.7 per cent and all banks met the Common Equity Tier1 (CET-1) requirement of 8 per cent.

The profitability of SCBs improved during H1 of FY25, with profit after tax (PAT) surging by 22.2 per cent (YoY). The cost of funds rose in sync with the tightening monetary policy  cycle.  During  Q2  of  FY25,  the  cost  of  funds increased marginally for SCBs. As the transmission was faster for lending rates relative to deposit rates and the overall yield on assets remained broadly stable during the last year, the net interest margin (NIM) has marginally declined across all bank groups. Despite a contraction in NIM, both return on equity and return on assets ratios improved in September 2024. Further, as the GNPAs and slippages declined, the provision coverage ratio improved further to 77 per cent at the end of September 2024 per cent from 74.9 per cent in March 2023.

## Credit Growth

At the end of November 2024, the growth in overall bank credit moderated to 11.8 per cent (YoY) from 15.2 per cent a year ago 8 .  The moderation in credit growth can be attributed to an increase in lending rates (as a result of monetary policy transmission of higher policy rates to higher lending rates) and the imposition of increased capital requirements for unsecured personal loans, credit cards and lending to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) by the RBI from 100 per cent to 125 per cent 9 .

## Introduction

Sector-wise, the growth in agriculture credit as of 29 November 2024 in the current financial year was 5.1 per cent.  The growth in idustrial credit picked up and stood at 4.4 per cent as of the end of November 2024, higher than 3.2 per cent recorded a year ago.  Across industries, bank credit  to  micro,  small,  and  medium  enterprises (MSMEs) have been growing faster than credit disbursal to large enterprises.  As of the end of November 2024, credit to MSMEs registered a YoY growth of 13 per cent, whereas it stood at 6.1 per cent for large enterprises. Credit growth to the services and personal loans segments also  moderated  to  5.9  per  cent  and  8.8  per  cent, respectively, as of the end of November 2024 in the current financial  year.    Amongst  the  services  sector,  the moderation has been  driven  by  a  slowdown  in  credit disbursal to NBFCs.  Vehicle and housing loans drove the moderation in the personal loans segment.  In terms of increasing risk weights to NBFCs and credit cards, RBI's policy interventions contributed to the moderation of credit growth in those segments.

## External trade

According to the latest trade update by UNCTAD 10  , the gradual increase in global trade that began in H2 of 2023 has persisted into 2024. The WTO database shows a YoY growth of 3.5 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, in global merchandise export and import indices in Q3 of 2024 (seasonally adjusted, 2005 Q1=100). Further, the global services exports and imports grew by 7.9 per cent and 6.7 per cent (YoY) during the same period.

Factors such as moderating global inflation, stable economic growth forecasts, and improving business activity are expected to foster positive momentum in global trade in  early 2025. Nonetheless, this optimistic view faces substantial challenges. Modest changes in U.S. tariffs can significantly impact global trade dynamics due to its role as a major consumer market and the interconnectedness of cross-border value chains. An increase in tariffs and

the  imposition  of  retaliatory  measures  can  harm international trade, investments, and overall economic growth. The tendency to impose measures to promote the production of sustainable and environmentally friendly products will also likely hinder the growth of international trade, especially in strategic sectors.

India's Merchandise Trade developments during FY23, FY24 and FY25 (April-Nov) may be seen in the table below.

The merchandise trade deficit decreased from USD 264.9 billion in FY23 to USD 241.9 billion in FY24. During FY25 (Apr-Dec), the trade deficit widened to USD 210.8 billion from USD 189.7 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. This was largely due to moderate export growth and a strong increase in merchandise imports in the first nine months of FY25.

## Balance of payment situation

As per the press release of the RBI, the developments in India's Balance of Payments for FY24 (April-Sept) and FY25 (April-Sept) may be seen in the Table 6. India's current account deficit stood at USD 21.4 billion (1.2 per cent of GDP) in H1 of FY25 compared to USS 20.2 billion (1.2 per cent of GDP) in H1 of FY24. Net invisibles receipts at USD 119.0 billion were higher in H1 of FY25 compared to  USD 101.0 billion a year ago, primarily because of higher net services receipts.

In  the Capital Account and Financial Account, net foreign direct investment inflows at USD 4.4 billion in H1 of FY25 were higher than USD 3.9 billion in H1 of FY24. Foreign portfolio investors recorded net inflows of USD 20.8 billion in H1 of FY25 compared with net inflows of USD 20.7 billion a year ago. During H1 of FY25, there was an accretion of USD 23.8 billion to the foreign exchange reserves (on a BoP basis).

## A. Indian Market Performance

- i. During FY25  (till November),  the Indian  stock market has achieved new record highs, consistently outperforming  its  emerging  market  peers  despite downside risks from geopolitical  uncertainties  and election-driven market volatility. In May 2024,  India's market capitalization  surpassed the  $5 trillion  mark, making it the fourth largest equity market globally and underscoring India's robust long-term growth potential. This  growth, combined with active listing activity  and SEBI's recent measures to temper excesses has fostered sustainable market expansion.
- ii. The performance of India's benchmark indices Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex surged by 8.1 per cent and 8.4 per cent during Apr-Nov 2024, respectively as against 28.6 per cent and 24.9 per  cent during FY24. The Indian indices corrected about 6 to 7% during Oct-Nov 24 after reaching all-time high in September 2024. The corrections were driven by combination of factors such as aggressive selling by FPIs due to excessive market valuation, weaker than  expected Q2  corporate earnings,  geopolitical tensions and elections in US. On an overall level, the allIndia market capitalisation grew by 15 per cent during FY25 (Apr- Nov).

## C. Secondary Markets:

- i. To promote a robust and regulated derivatives market with enhanced investor protection, revised eligibility criteria have been introduced for the entry and exit of stocks in the derivatives segment on exchanges. This change aims to ensure that stocks in the derivatives market maintain liquidity and participation levels that support market stability and development. The criteria for exit shall apply to only those stocks which have completed at least 6 months from the month of entry into the derivative segment.  In addition, Product Success Framework (PSF), in line with the PSF for index derivatives, has also been introduced in single stock futures and options. This framework will evaluate liquidity and participation levels in single stock derivatives to  ensure  that the  liquidity  and  participation witnessed in the derivative markets are supportive of market development, regulation, and investor protection. The stocks that do not satisfy the PSF would exit the derivative segment.
- ii. In order to review the existing regulatory measures for investor protection while ensuring the orderly development  and  strengthening  of  equity derivatives market,  following  measures  were introduced in staggered manner:
3.  Upfront collection of Option Premium from options buyers,
4.  Removal of calendar spread treatment on the Expiry Day,
5.  Intraday monitoring of position limits,
6.  Revised contract size for index derivatives,
7.  Rationalization of Weekly Index derivatives products,
8.  Increase in tail risk coverage on the day of options expiry
- iii. In order to bring consistency and uniformity with respect to independent evaluation of performance of MIIs by an external agency, the broad framework with basic minimum criteria has been put in place. To  ensure  consistency  in  the  manner  of assessment and outcomes across similar MIIs, compare performance of such MIIs and monitor trends over time,  a rating  framework has been developed  which  would  be  assigned  after evaluation of the MIIs.
- iv. Existing processes related to charges levied by MIIs  on  their  members  (i.e.  stockbrokers, depository participants, clearing members), entail volume based slab-wise charge structure. It was

increase in client base, cumulative AUM of the portfolio management services as at the end of Oct 2024 stood at 36.2 lakh crore, up by 19.1 per cent over the previous year.

found in many cases that the aggregated charges collected by the members from the end clients is higher than the end of month charges paid to the MII. Hence it was mandated that MII charges which are to be recovered from the end client should be True to Label and MIIs were directed to redesign the  existing  charge  structure  and  associated processes. This will ensure that the fee structures are transparent and True to Label to reflect, the actual services provided.

- v. Taking into account the changing market dynamics of the equity derivatives segment, with a view to have a more comprehensive understanding of the prevalent tail risk in the equity derivatives segment, SEBI has specified additional hypothetical stress testing scenarios/ methodologies for determining the Minimum Required Corpus (MRC) of Core SGF in the equity derivatives segment.
- vi. To  safeguard  client  assets  and  prevent  the potential  misuse  of  securities  by  brokers,  a mechanism of pay-out of securities directly  to clients'  demat account has been  implemented wherein securities from trade settlements will be directly  credited  to  the  client's  demat  account rather than the broker's pool account. Under this system, Clearing Corporations will handle the payout of securities, ensuring they are credited directly to  the  client's  demat  account following  trade execution.
- vii. For prevention and detection of fraud or market abuse, institutional mechanism changes have been implemented to cast responsibility on brokers to put in place systems for detection and prevention of fraud or market abuse including setting up of robust surveillance and control systems, ensuring appropriate escalation and reporting mechanisms (including to  exchanges), and  having a whistle blower policy in place.
- viii. To address the issue of  liquidity for  investors, especially retail investors, and also to enhance their investment in debt securities, a framework of providing a Liquidity Window facility by the issuers through use of  put options exercisable on prespecified dates/intervals  was introduced. The issuers can offer this facility on an ISIN basis to eligible investors at their discretion for prospective issuances.

## Stock Market Performance

Notwithstanding the intermittent corrections, Indian markets showed consistent upward trend until September 2024, scaling new  all-time highs.   Strong  domestic economic prospects, robust domestic institutional investor inflows, FPI investment, anticipated policy pivots from major central banks etc. drove the uptrend. However, the uptrend moderated since October  2024, driven by economic stimulus measures in China, U.S. presidential election and the valuation concerns.

## F. GIFT IFSC &amp; International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA)

- (i) The Union Budget announcement (2015-16) paved the way for operationalizing the maiden IFSC in GIFT City  Multi-Service  SEZ, Gujarat.  Government of  India implemented a  major financial  sector reform  by establishing  and  operationalizing  India's  maiden International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in GIFT City, Gujarat.

- (iii) The Hon'ble Prime Minister of India during his July 2022 visit to GIFT IFSC articulated his vision for GIFT City and  stated  that  ' the  vision of  India's  future  is associated with GIFT City, which is an important gateway to  connect India with global opportunities' .  He further stated  'that if  one integrates  with  GIFT  City,  one  will integrate with whole world'.
- (iv) To  further  promote  ease of  doing business  and provide for dedicated regulatory intervention, Government of India through an Act of Parliament in 2019 set up the International  Financial  Services  Centres Authority (IFSCA) as a unified  regulator for  development and regulation of financial markets in the IFSCs in India.

India (RBI), Securities and Exchange  Board of  India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development  Authority of  India  (IRDAI)  &amp;  Pension  Fund  Regulatory  and Development  Authority  (PFRDA),  in  so  far  as development and regulation of financial products, financial institutions  and financial  services  within  the IFSCs in concerned.

With internationally aligned regulatory regime, competitive tax structure and ease of doing business, GIFT IFSC is fast emerging as a preferred jurisdiction for availing wide array of international financial Services.
- (vi) In this direction, over the last three years, IFSCA has endeavored to develop a regulatory architecture for  IFSCs,  which  is  aligned  to  international  best practices  and also  has  ease  of  understanding  for enhanced compliance. IFSCA has since its inception come up with 30+ Regulations to regulate Banking, Capital  Markets, Insurance,  Bullion, Fund  Industry, Global In House Centers, Foreign University/foreign institutions  etc.  within  IFSC.  IFSCA  being a  unified Authority  for  IFSCs  in  India,  has  undertaken consolidation of domestic regulations to a large extent pertaining to Insurance, Fund Industry, Capital Markets etc.,  which  is  unique  in  the  Indian  regulatory architecture.

## Annual Report 2024-2025

- (b) On  June  27,  2024,  the  Securities  and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued a circular amending the SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2019.

-  conducting  all  current  and  capital account transactions in foreign jurisdictions  (excluding  IFSCs)  via  a Foreign Currency Account held in IFSC.
- (d) The  Cabinet  approved the  signing  of  a Memorandum of Understanding  (MoU) between the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) and the  Labuan Financial  Services Authority (FSA) on  16th
- August,  2024.  The  MoU,  exchanged subsequently between the Authorities, aims to strengthen  bilateral  relations,  promote knowledge  sharing,  and  enhance  the development of financial centers.
- (e) In  order to  give impetus to development of pension landscape in IFSC, schemes operated by  pension funds in IFSC  were notified as financial product  under IFSCA Act, 2019 to cater to global clientele.

To further strengthen the framework and facilitate informed decision-making, improved transparency, and reduced 'greenwashing' risks, IFSCA has also enabled Credit Rating Agencies to  undertake additional  activities relating to ESG Ratings and Data Products Providers
- (i) To materialize the goal of Digital economy, the Single Window IT System (SWIT) portal was launched by Hon'ble Prime Minister at a public function  at Ahmedabad  on September 16, 2024. This portal will provide a one-stop online solution,  eliminating the  need for multiple permissions  and excessive  documentation, and facilitating inter-regulatory  coordination between RBI, SEBI, and other regulators and promote ease of doing business.

- 4.3.6 G20 Brazilian Presidency, continued working on the financial sector issues priorities taken forward from the earlier G20 Presidencies. Noteworthy progress has taken place under  priorities like Regulation of Crypto Assets,  Cross  Border  Payments Roadmap,  etc. continuing from Indian Presidency. However, much work needs to be done on areas like NBFI and Cyber security and their impact on financial stability. To support the work under Brazilian Presidency, continuous engagement was maintained through various virtual meetings / conference calls of Plenary, SCSI, RCG, etc. and inputs on surveys and  reports  circulated  by  FSB  were  provided  in consultation with the regulators from time to time.
- 4.3.7 For 2024, under G20 Brazilian Presidency, it was also proposed to work towards developing a reporting framework for mitigating system-level vulnerabilities for the financial sector from cyber risks, especially through greater convergence in cyber incident reporting  and coordination of relevant definitions and terminologies. In New  Delhi  Leader's  Declaration  of  G20,  FSB's recommendations to achieve greater convergence in cyber incident reporting, updates to the Cyber Lexicon and Concept Note for a Format for Incident Reporting Exchange (FIRE) were welcomed. Subsequently, FSB has  established  a  new  working  group (FIRE  WG) comprising financial sector authorities  under the FSB Standing  Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC). In 2024, the FSB developed FIRE in consultation with private sector participants. The process included a Discovery Phase to identify commonalities in incident reporting needs and a Design Phase to develop the components of FIRE. As per consultative report of

FSB, a Testing Phase is underway to validate the design and robustness of FIRE using different incident types and scenarios. After the public consultation, the final version of FIRE is expected to be published by April 2025 under the South African  G20 Presidency,  with a  workshop planned for 2027 to review experiences and determine the need for revisions.

4.3.8 Carrying forward from Indian Presidency, FSB is also actively pursuing the G20's Roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments under the current G20 South African presidency to achieve global targets for faster, cheaper, more transparent and inclusive cross-border payments by 2027.

As  regards  the regulation of crypto assets, it was stated in the New Delhi Leaders' Declaration of G20 that they welcomed the IMFFSB Synthesis Paper, including a Roadmap, that will support a coordinated and comprehensive policy  and regulatory  framework for crypto assets  and that the Finance Ministers  and Central  Bank Governors  will discuss taking forward the Roadmap at their meeting in October 2023. Subsequently, the G20  membership adopted the roadmap outlined in the Synthesis Paper as the G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets in the meeting of the FMCBGs in October 2023 and asked the IMF and FSB to provide regular and structured updates on the progress of implementation  of the G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets. Accordingly, FSB submitted the Crypto Roadmap Status Report to G20 in October 2024. Under the South African Presidency 2025, the aim will be to promote the implementation of those recommendations to  reduce  the  scope  for  regulatory  arbitrage, fragmentation and evasion.

4.3.9 Other G20 priorities going  forward in  2025, include adoption of Artificial  Intelligence (AI) across financial  sector  including  risks  emanating from  it, addressing risks  from NBFI leverage, address issues related to non-bank data availability, use and quality, and review of monitoring the implementation  of the FSB recommendations.

ADB will also strengthen its human  development,  and  agriculture  and  rural development portfolio while keeping its focus on basic urban services, prioritizing lagging states and districts. ADB shall be engaging in upstream studies and sustained dialogues with key central line ministries to identify their development priorities, financing, and knowledge needs. At the  state level, ADB shall  pursue a differentiated approach to prioritize projects on basic services, critical infrastructure and services,  institutional strengthening, and private sector development through the sovereign operations in  low-income  states.  Support for  more developed states will focus on transformational programs with policy and knowledge advice, combined with nonsovereign operations.

8.10.9 The  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic Cooperation  (SASEC)  Program  brings  together Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka in a project-based partnership. Under this flagship program, ADB has been working with the SASEC countries  to build  cross-border  power  connectivity,

## Annual Report 2024-2025

facilitate regional trade, and connect transport network for movement of goods and people. SASEC countries share a common vision of boosting intraregional trade and cooperation  in South Asia,  while also  developing connectivity and trade with Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the global market. The SASEC Vision was launched in April 2017 in the SASEC Finance Ministers' Meeting in New Delhi. It articulates shared aspirations of SASEC countries and  set the  path to achieve these  through regional collaboration. The vision document lays out a plan to transform the subregion by leveraging natural resources,  promoting  industry  linkages  for  the development of regional value chains, and expanding the region's trade and commerce through the development of  subregional  gateways and  hubs. The  SASEC Operational Plan presents the strategic objectives of the SASEC partnership, and the operational priorities of the four main SASEC sectors: transport, trade facilitation, energy,  and  economic corridor  development. It  is supported by a list of potential projects regularly updated by SASEC countries to be implemented during 2016-2025.

Bhutan  hosted the  SASEC Working  Group meetings on transport, trade facilitation, and energy in Thimphu from 4-7 November 2024. More than 100 government officials of the SASEC countries participated. The  decisions  of  the SASEC  working groups  were discussed and endorsed in the SASEC Senior Officers' meeting (SOM) held in Thimphu from 8 November 2024. The SASEC SOM updated Action Plan of SASEC Initiative (2024-2026) and asked ADB to initiate work on next rolling plan of APSI (2025-2027). The SOM resolved to focus on initiatives on decarbonatization and digitalization for enhanced regional cooperation and integration.

As of  30  June 2024, SASEC Countries have signed and implemented 87 projects worth $20.75 billion, with ADB financing of $12.80 billion. The transport and tourism sector accounts for most projects (51 projects worth a cumulative $8.70 billion), followed by energy (16 projects  worth  $1.57  billion),  economic  corridor development (7 projects worth  $1.64 billion),  trade facilitation (7 projects worth $343.67 million), ICT (2 projects worth $12.57 million), and health (3 projects worth $356.47 million).  In  addition, ADB  technical assistance  has supported SASEC investment projects in India, regional cooperation forums, and knowledge-sharing initiatives, and pilot  projects  since  2001. An  additional 155 technical assistance projects with total cumulative value of $224.78 million has been provided to assist in project preparation, strategic planning, and capacity building. ADB is assisting Government of India in extending project development support through project readiness financing (PRF) loans, along with  grants in  the form  of knowledge  support technical assistance (KSTA) to northeastern region (NER) states. PRFs enable quick response to continued demand for project development and finance project preparation and design activities for investments that are expected to be financed under one or more ensuing ADB-financed projects with quality project designs and a high level of implementation readiness. PRF and KSTA in NER aim to support development of investment plans/projects for key sectors and preparation of feasibility studies, detailed designs, procurement process, and timely completion of preconstruction  activities of priority  projects.  Building institutional capacity is one of the key components of PRFs and KSTAs, which intend to support infrastructure planning and implementation capacities of the line departments. Presently, Sikkim Road Sector PRF ($2.5 million), Tripura Urban and Tourism Development PRF ($4.2 million), and the Mizoram Urban Transport PRF ($4.5 million) are under implementation. Tripura Industry PRF ($2 million), Tripura City Infrastructure PRF ($3 million), Manipur Road Sector PRF ($5 million), and Nagaland Urban Infrastructure PRF ($2 million) are under processing. KSTA support is also being mobilized for developing sector investment plans in Tripura and Assam (Road Sector and Urban &amp; Rural Water Supply - Sanitation).

8.10.10  The Capacity Development Resource Center (CDRC) at ADB's India Resident Mission is a  unique institutional  arrangement  to help  build capacities  of executing  agencies  in ADB  procedures,  project implementation, thematic topics, and presentation of good practices to support robust portfolio performance. In 2024, CDRC conducted 25 capacity development programs benefitting  1,408 executing  and implementing agency staff (24% women) from 86 projects covering entire India portfolio. Majority of participants evaluated the programs as useful and 96% rated it as relevant, demonstrating that  the  training  courses  are  demand  driven  and operationally relevant. A knowledge exchange program was organized by CDRC for the representatives from Govt of  Indonesia and  Nepal. The  program shared India's project  management practices  with the  delegations, covering project readiness checklist of DEA, Capacity Development Resource Center, MDB financing, digitized solutions, procurement, safeguards clearances, tripartite portfolio review meetings (TPRMs) and environmental clearances. For long term sustainability and large-scale replication to benefit Indian agencies, CDRC is working towards  institutionalizing training  programs within the national eco system to benefit other MDBs, Bilaterals, GOI and  State Government  agencies. The  plan  is proposed for implementation during 2025-2026.

8.10.11 Technical Assistance (TA)  program has  also evolved in line with the loan program. TA helps DMCs enhance capacity, improve project preparedness and implementation, promote  technology transfer,  and undertake analytical studies.

8.10.12    ADB's Technical Assistance  Special  Fund (TASF) provides technical assistance improving capacity in the formulation, design, and implementation of projects to facilitate effective use of external financing. India has been voluntarily contributing to TASF since 1970.

The 19 th  G20 Summit was held under the Brazilian G20 Presidency in Rio de Janeiro on November 18-19, 2024.

G20 issues are discussed through two parallel tracks,  viz.,  Finance  Track and  Sherpa Track. The Finance Track of the G20 discusses global economic and financial issues. The track is headed by G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors who are assisted by G20 Finance and Central Bank Deputies. Hon'ble Finance Minister and Governor, RBI jointly head the G20 Finance  Track  work  in  India.  They  are  assisted respectively by Secretary, Economic Affairs (who is India's G20 Finance Deputy) and Deputy Governor, RBI (who is India's  G20 Central Bank Deputy). The G20  Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors usually meet three to four times a year. They finally report to the G20 Leaders who are the apex decision-makers in the G20. Meetings of Finance and Central Bank Deputies (FCBD) are held in the run-up to every FMCBG Meeting. Technical-level discussions  are  held through  meetings  of  Working Groups, usually 3-4 times a year.

The Finance Track comprises 8 workstreams. There are Working Groups for 5 of these workstreams and a Joint Finance-Health Taskforce, listed as under:

1. Framework Working Group (FWG)
2. International Financial Architecture Working Group (IFA WG)
3. Infrastructure Working Group (IWG)
4. Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG)
5. Financial Sector Issues
6. Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI)
7. International Taxation
8. Joint Finance and Health Task Force (JFHTF)

The mandates of G20 Finance Track workstreams along with relevant details are as follows:

1. Framework Working Group (FWG) discusses the global economic outlook, monitoring of global risks and uncertainties and recommends possible areas of policy  coordination  aimed  at  promoting  Strong, Sustainable, Balanced, and Inclusive Growth (SSBIG) across the G20.

## Brazilian G20 Presidency 2024

Brazil assumed the Presidency of G20 from India on December 1, 2023. The Brazilian Presidency is centred

on the theme, "Building a fair world and a sustainable planet", and has three overarching priorities:

- a) Social inclusion and the fight against hunger
- b) Energy transition and sustainable development in its three aspects (social, economic and environmental)
- c) Reform of global governance institutions

Brazil Presidency also set up two new G20 Task Forces,  viz.,  the  Global Alliance  against  Hunger and Poverty (TF GAHP), and Global Mobilization against Climate Change (TF CLIMA). Under TF GAHP, the Presidency launched the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty at the Rio Summit in November 2024.

The first  communique 1 of  the  G20  Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) under the Brazilian Presidency was adopted on July 25-26, 2024 during the third meeting of the G20 FMCBGs held in Rio de Janeiro,  Brazil. The  key factor  that enabled  the Brazilian Presidency to arrive at an agreed Communique was the consensus reached by G20 Sherpas to issue a separate Chair's Statement on geopolitical issues along with  Ministerial  Communiques. This  was  aimed  at separating the geopolitical debate from the subject matter of Ministerial Meetings. In July, the Brazilian Presidency also produced  a standalone  G20 International Tax Declaration 2   under which the G20 members committed to strengthen their respective domestic reform endeavours, engage cooperatively to ensure that ultra-high-net-worth individuals are  effectively taxed  and make  significant progress towards the  implementation of Pillar 2  and finalisation of all components of Pillar 1, among others.

The fourth and final meeting of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) under the Brazilian Presidency was held on 23-24 October 2024, in Washington DC, US, on the sidelines of the IMF/WB Annual Meetings. The  G20  FMCBG meeting  was preceded by the Fifth G20 Finance and Central Bank Deputies Meeting on 22 October 2024, during which the Deputies negotiated the G20 Communiqué, leading to its  adoption  by  FMCBGs on October  24, 2024. The Communique may kindly be seen at https://www.g20.org/ pt-br/documentos/trilha-de-financas/4th-fmcbgcommunique.pdf/@@download/file

The G20 Brazil Presidency also hosted a G20 Joint Meeting of Finance, Climate &amp; Environment, and Foreign Affairs  Ministers and  Governors of  Central Banks on 24 October 2024. This meeting marked the

## Department of Economic Affairs I

culmination of the efforts of the G20 Task Force for the Mobilization against Climate Change (TF CLIMA) during the Brazilian Presidency. The Joint Ministerial Statement and the TF CLIMA outcome document may be seen at https://www.g20.org/en/tracks/sherpa-track/climatechange

The  19th G20 Leaders' Summit was held  on November 18 and 19, 2024, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The outcome of this summit is the G20 Rio de Janeiro Leaders' Declaration 3 , which was adopted by the G20 Leaders. The declaration reflects the key outcomes of the Sherpa and Finance Tracks of the G20 under the Brazilian Presidency.

## Key priorities from the 2023 Indian Presidency taken forward by the Brazilian Presidency in 2024

- a) Strengthening Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs): In  2023,  Indian  Presidency held  focused discussions on  several  aspects  of  MDB  evolution, including incentive structure, operational approaches, and financial capacity for making MDBs better equipped to address the global challenges of the 21st century and the  development needs of low and middle-income countries.  The  two  key  outcomes  of  the  Indian Presidency under the MDB agenda were the 2 volume Report of the G20 Independent Expert Group (IEG) on Strengthening  MDBs and the G20 Roadmap for the implementation of  the recommendations of the  G20 Independent Review of Multilateral Development Banks' Capital Adequacy Frameworks (CAF). The Brazilian Presidency's outcome on the MDB agenda in 2024 is the G20 Roadmap for better, bigger, and more effective MDBs. The Roadmap is a key deliverable of the Brazilian G20 Presidency which  was endorsed  by the  G20 Leaders in the November 2024 G20 Rio Summit. The Roadmap has been built on the mandate received from G20 Leaders in New Delhi Declaration and identifies recommendations and actions for MDB reforms based on the IEG Report.

b) Macroeconomic risks stemming from Climate Change and Transition Pathways: One of  the  key priorities of Brazilian Presidency in 2024 is assessing the distributional  implications  of  climate  change  and sustainable  transition policies. The G20  Note on  the macroeconomic and distributional impacts of climate change and transition policies, was delivered to the G20 FMCBGs in the October G20 FMCBG Communique. The note builds on the 2023 G20 report on macroeconomic

1 https://www.gov.br/fazenda/pt-br/assuntos/g20/declaracoes/2-3rd-fmcbg-communique.pdf. It may be noted  that in the first meeting of the G0 FMCBGs under the Brazilian Presidency, a Chair's Summary was produced by the Presidency since a consensus on the communique was unable to be reached at by the membership due to differences on how the geopolitical issues may be referenced in the FMCBG communique. 2 https://www.g20.org/pt-br/documentos/trilha-de-financas/1-g20-ministerial-declaration-international-taxation-cooperation.pdf/@@download/file 3 https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/l11hh2mb/g20-rio-de-janeiro-leaders-declaration-final.pdf

risks  stemming  from climate  change  and  transition pathways, which was endorsed by the G20 Leaders in New Delhi.

c) Advancing Financial Inclusion: Implementation of 2023 Financial Inclusion Action Plan (FIAP) endorsed under India's G20 Presidency and two FIAP deliverables were produced in 2024, viz. G20 Policy Options for improving 'last mile' access and quality inclusion through digital infrastructure, including Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI), consumer protection and other FIAP objectives. (endorsed by the G20 FMCBGs in October 2024 Ministerial meeting) and  the New G20 Action  Plan for  MSME Financing (the G20 FMCBGs took note of the advances regarding this deliverable and looked forward to its final version).  In addition,  GPFI also  produced "Updates to Leaders on the Progress towards G20 Remittances Target" as one of the continuing areas of GPFI.

Additionally,  India, alongside Italy,  managed  the GPFI Co-Chair Secretariat, which included implementing GPFI priorities, overseeing the development of GPFI deliverables,  coordinating  with  all  members,  and organizing meetings.

Further, in January 2023 'India's G20 Task Force on  Digital  Public  Infrastructure  for  Economic Transformation, Financial Inclusion and Development' was established to oversee and facilitate achieving India's G20 Presidency agenda and priorities on Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and Financial Inclusion. The Task Force was led by the Co-Chairs - Shri Amitabh Kant, G20 Sherpa of India and Shri Nandan Nilekani, Co-founder and Chairman of Infosys and the Founding Chairman of UIDAI (Aadhaar). It released the 'Report of India's G20 Task Force on Digital Public Infrastructure' by 'India's G20 Task Force on Digital Public Infrastructure  for Economic Transformation, Financial Inclusion  and Development' in 2024.

d) Scaling up sustainable finance: During India's G20  Presidency, the  SFWG developed Technical Assistance Action Plan (TAAP) to scale up capacitybuilding efforts in sustainable finance. Under the Brazilian Presidency, the Implementation Mechanism for G20 TAAP was convened by UNDP to facilitate knowledge sharing, and tailoring capacity-building efforts in line with the national circumstances. To discuss the progress on the implementation of TAAP a G20 session was held on the side-lines of 4th SFWG Meeting. Further, expanding the area of work under Analytical framework for SDGaligned finance developed during the Indian Presidency, the Brazilian Presidency took financing of Nature based Solutions as one of the key priority areas under SFWG for 2024.

- e) Crypto-assets: Policy and Regulations: Under the Indian Presidency, a joint IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper was developed which provided policy and regulatory recommendations  to  identify  and  respond  to macroeconomic and financial stability risks associated with crypto assets and outlined a roadmap for effective and coordinated policy implementation. The paper was welcomed by the Leaders in the G20 NDLD and the G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets was adopted at the G20 FMCBG meeting held in Marrakesh.  During the July  2024  G20  FMCBG  meeting,  Ministers  and Governors recognized the joint efforts of the IMF and the FSB, in collaboration  with  the  World Bank,  the Financial Action Task  Force  (FATF)  and its  global network, and SSBs, towards the implementation of the G20 Roadmap on Crypto Assets, including beyond G20 jurisdictions. The first status report related to the G20 roadmap on crypto assets was welcomed at the 4th FMCBG in October 2024.
- f) International Taxation Agenda: One  of  the flagship priorities of the Indian G20 Presidency under the International  Taxation  agenda  was  enhancing  tax transparency.  On  the  request  of  the  Indian  G20 Presidency, the OECD had presented a report to the G20 on  'A  roadmap  for  enhancing  international  tax transparency on real estate' which was taken note of in the New Delhi Leaders Declaration (NDLD). Under the Brazilian Presidency, the work is being carried forward, and during  the 3rd FMCBG Meeting, the OECD has presented a report titled 'Strengthening International Tax Transparency on Real Estate - From Concept to Reality', building  on the  July 2023  Report to  the Indian  G20 Presidency. In the Ministerial Declaration issued by G20 Finance Ministers on International Cooperation, OECD has been invited  to continue  work  on  exchanging foreseeably relevant information regarding real estate for tax purpose, building on the Indian G20 Presidency.
- g) Financing Cities of Tomorrow: In 2023 the G20 Leaders  emphasised  the  need  for  enhanced mobilisation  of finances and efficient  use of  existing resources in the efforts to make the cities of tomorrow inclusive, resilient, and sustainable. This emphasis on inclusivity and resilience has been carried forward under the Brazilian  G20 Presidency in  the form of two key priorities identified in the Infrastructure Working Group work  plan,  namely,  financing  climate-resilient infrastructure  and linking  infrastructure with  poverty reduction. The  report  pertaining  to  the  priority 'Approaches for Financing and Investment in ClimateResilient Infrastructure' has been welcomed in the July 2024  FMCBG  meeting  while  the  other  report 'Infrastructure  and  Poverty  Reduction:  Innovative

Policies for Effective Access' has been endorsement in the  October  2024  FMCBG Meeting. The report on 'Infrastructure  and  Poverty  Reduction:  Innovative Policies for Effective  Access' draws upon the G20/OECD report on 'Financing Cities of Tomorrow' under the Indian G20 Presidency to highlight the  need for  attracting private financing, and leveraging innovative financing and funding mechanisms.

h) Finance-Health Collaboration: The  August 2023 report on  Framework for  Health, Social,  Economic Vulnerabilities  &amp;  Risks  (FEVR),  under  the  Indian Presidency, envisioned an update and expansion of the analysis in  the existing  Framework, as  well  as  the development of  a comprehensive report on  global health,  social,  and  economic  vulnerabilities.  The Brazilian G20  Presidency has  further updated  and refined the Framework as presented in the G20 Global Report on FEVR related to Pandemics. They have also elevated  a  focus  on  addressing inequity,  including through discussing  the social determinants of health (SDH): the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, that impact health and well-being across the life course and the inequities in access to power, decision-making, money and resources that give rise to these conditions.

The New Delhi Leaders Declaration also supported advancing  work on  "mapping pandemic  response financing options and gaps", as well as further discussions on  optimizing,  coordinating,  and, where  necessary, enhancing  financing  mechanisms  for  efficient deployment. In this regard, the G20 Operational Playbook provides a much-needed overview of pandemic response financing needs and sources, covering both domestic and external financing  options for  different categories  of response.

The second BRICS FMCBG meeting in October saw the adoption of a Joint Statement and a Report to Leaders on the  issue  of  local currencies,  payment instruments and platforms as was tasked by the Leaders in the Johannesburg II declaration of 2023 4 .  The key outcomes under the Russian Chairmanship in 2024 were as follows:

## a. Improvement of International Monetary and Financial System

The Russian BRICS Chair focused on improving the international monetary and financial system (IMFS) in order to make it more responsive to the needs of all countries. The key  idea was that the  IMFS needs to better  meet the  needs of  developing countries  and adequately reflect their  growing share in the  global economy. The Chair prepared the BRICS Chairmanship Research on Improvement of the International Monetary and Financial System. The report was taken note of by the  FMCBGs through  the Joint  Statement and  the FMCBGs appreciated the efforts of the Chair towards this work.

## b. Practical Financial Cooperation Initiatives

The Chair  made efforts  to  develop  practical financial  cooperation  initiatives.  The  Chair  was instrumental in developing a conceptual document on the BRICS Cross-Border Payment  Initiative (BCBPI), a voluntary and non-binding project, aimed at enhancing cooperation on cross-border payments among BRICS countries. The Chair  also made  efforts to  introduce voluntary initiatives  -  BRICS  Clear  (to  complement existing  financial  market  infrastructure) and  BRICS (Re)Insurance (to develop an independent reinsurance capacity).

## c. Cooperation on Customs and Tax matters

15.2.1 The AfDB is a regional multilateral development finance institution established to contribute to the economic development and social progress of African countries that are the institution's Regional Member Countries (RMCs). The AfDB was founded following an agreement signed by member states on August 14, 1963, in Khartoum, Sudan, which became effective on September 10, 1964. The  AfDB comprises three entities, jointly referred to as the African Development  Bank  Group,  namely  the  African Development Bank (AfDB), the  African Development Fund (ADF), and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF). The AfDB is headquartered in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.

15.2.2 The Bank comprises 54 African countries known as regional member countries (RMCs) and 27 non-African countries  known as  non-regional member countries (NRMCs). When the African Development Bank (AfDB) was established, only independent African countries were eligible to be shareholders of the Bank, and later in 1982, the memberships were opened to Non-African Countries.

15.2.3 India is a long-standing partner of the AfDB, and relations date back to 1982 when India joined the African Development Fund (ADF) and joined the African Development Bank (AfDB) in 1983 as its non-regional / non-borrowing member. All 81  AfDB members (54 RMCs &amp; 27 NRMCs) are grouped into 20 constituencies (13 regional and 7 non-regional). India is part of the NIIC Nordic India Ireland Constituency, comprising Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Ireland.

India participates in the Board of Governors (BoG) meetings, which are held annually, and raises concerns during the Board of Directors (BoD) meetings via its constituency. India is represented in the

## Major Policy Initiatives/ Achievements of PIU

## 1. Financial support to Public Private Partnerships in Infrastructure (VGF Scheme)

The  Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) launched the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme for providing financial assistance to financially unviable but socially/ economically desirable PPP projects. Under this scheme, economic sector projects may get up to 40% of the Capex as VGF grant. The VGF Scheme includes higher provisions of VGF grant for  social sectors i.e., Health,  Education,  Water  Supply,  Waste  Water Treatment, Solid Waste Management, etc. Social sector projects may get up to 80% of the Capex and up to 50% of Opex for 5 years after the Commercial Operation Date (CoD) as VGF grant. Social Sector projects get VGF grant under the following two categories:

- a) Sub scheme -1 caters to Social Sectors such as Wastewater Treatment, Water Supply, Solid Waste Management, Health &amp; Education sectors, etc. The  projects eligible  under this category should have at least 100% Operational Cost recovery. The Central Government will provide maximum of 30% of Capex of the project as VGF and State Government/Sponsoring  Central Ministry/Statutory Entity may provide additional support up to 30% of Capex.
- b) Sub scheme -2 supports demonstration/pilot social sectors projects. The projects may be from Health &amp; Education sectors. The projects eligible under this category should have at least 50% Operational  Cost  recovery.  The  Central Government will provide a maximum of 40% of the Capex of the Project and a maximum of 25% of  Opex of  the project  for  first  five  years  of commercial  operations as  VGF. The  State Government/Sponsoring Central  Ministry/ Statutory Entity may provide additional support up to 40% of the Capex of the Project and upto 25% of Opex of the project for first five years of commercial operations.

## Annual Report 2024-2025

During the financial year 2024-25, under  the Scheme for Financial Support to Public Private Partnerships in Infrastructure, projects with  a TPC of ` 549.91 Crore received  In-Principle Approval, while projects with a TPC of ` 354 Crore were granted Final Approval. Additionally, DEA disbursed ` 201 Crore as VGF under the scheme during the same period.

## 2. Public  Private  Partnership  Appraisal Committee (PPPAC)

The  Public  Private  Partnership Appraisal Committee (PPPAC) is the apex body for appraisal of PPP projects in  the Central  Sector. The  streamlined appraisal mechanism for PPP projects ensures speedy appraisal  of  projects,  eliminates  delays,  adopts international best practices, and promotes uniformity in appraisal mechanism and guidelines. The PPPAC is chaired by Secretary, DEA with Secretaries of Department of  Expenditure,  Department of  Legal Affairs,  the Sponsoring Central Ministry/Department and CEO, NITI Aayog as members to consider  and appraise  the proposals for Central Sector PPP Projects. During the FY  2024-25, Public  Private  Partnership Appraisal Committee has recommended 7 projects with a Total Project Cost of ` 35,880.42 Crores.

## 3. Financial Support for Project Development Expenses of PPP Projects (IIPDF Scheme)

The very success of PPP projects depends on how well the project is structured. Since PPP projects are complex in nature, conceiving a project demands expertise of experienced  professionals in  the field  (Transaction Advisers). Generally, hiring transaction advisers for project development involves substantial costs and, many times, Project Sponsoring Authorities (PSAs) face a financial crunch  in  financing  this  cost.  Thus, Department  of Economic Affairs (DEA) has launched the IIPDF Scheme on 03.11.2022 as a Central Sector Scheme for funding such project development expenses. IIPDF Scheme provides necessary support to the PSAs, both in the Centre and the State Governments, by extending financial assistance in meeting the cost of transaction advisory services engaged in the development of PPP projects. Funding under IIPDF Scheme can be for a maximum amount of ` 5 Crore for a single proposal. Any funding requirement over and above ` 5 Crore may be borne by the PSAs. Under this Scheme, till date, 31 proposals amounting to ` 64.13 Crore have been approved.

## 4. Empanelment of Transaction Advisors(TAs)

To create an enabling environment for stepping up of private investment in infrastructure and to cater to State Governments demand, DEA has empanelled 12 transaction  advisors  for  PPP  projects  to  provide necessary support to project sponsoring authorities in transaction of PPP projects. The objective of empanelling TAs is to provide access to quality advisory support for PPP projects. This would help the Project Sponsoring Authorities (PSAs) to appoint TAs without delay. This list of TAs is widely used by Project Sponsoring Authorities (PSAs) for onboarding TAs for PPP projects.

## 5. Major Initiatives

## 5.1 PPP Policy-related matters

To strengthen  the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) ecosystem in the country, the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) has undertaken several initiatives during  the financial  year 2024-25.

The Union Cabinet has approved introducing a new pension scheme, the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for the government employees on 24 th  August, 2024 based upon the recommendations of the NPS Review Committee constituted in April, 2023.

## Key Elements of UPS

Following  are  the  key  elements  of  UPS  as approved by the Cabinet in its meeting of 24.08.2024:-

- a) Assured Annuity will be available in the following cases:
- i. In case of an employee superannuating after qualifying service of 10 years from the date of superannuation.
- ii. In case of Government retiring an employee under the provisions of FR 56 (j) (which is not a penalty under CCS(CCA) Rules) from the date of such retirement.
- iii. In  case  of  voluntary  retirement  after  a minimum qualifying service period of 25 years from the date such employee would have superannuated,  if  the  service  period  had continued to superannuation.

Assured annuity will not be available in case of removal or dismissal from service, resignation, etc. In such cases, UPS shall not apply.

The rate of full assured annuity will be @ 50% of 12 monthly average basic pay immediately prior to superannuation. Full assured annuity is payable after a minimum 25 years of qualifying service. In case  of  lesser  service  period,  proportionate assured annuity would be admissible. A minimum guaranteed annuity of Rs. 10,000 per month shall be admissible in case of exit from the NPS on superannuation after 10 years of qualifying service.

In case of death of the annuity holder (pensioner) after superannuation, family annuity @ 60% of the  annuity  admissible  to  the  pensioner immediately before his/her demise will be assured to  the  legally  wedded  spouse  (spouse  legally wedded as on the date of superannuation).

Dearness Relief will be available on the assured annuity, minimum guaranteed annuity and family annuity as the case may be. The Dearness Relief will  be  worked  out  in  the  same  manner  as Dearness Allowance  applicable  to  serving employees.  Dearness Relief will be payable only when payment of assured annuity commences. In cases of voluntary retirement after a minimum 25  years  of  qualifying  service,  calculation  of Dearness Relief will commence from the date on which the employee would have superannuated if she/he had continued in service.

b)

c)

d)

e)

- f) A  lump  sum  payment  will  be  allowed  on superannuation @10% of monthly emoluments (basic pay + DA) for every completed six months of qualifying service. This lump sum payment will not affect the quantum of assured annuity.

## Financial Implication

The  annual  estimated  cost  of  the  additional Government contribution of 4.5%, as recommended by the Committee, for the first year, will be around Rs.6,250 crore. One-time cost of around Rs. 800 crore as estimated on account of arrear payments to the past retirees.

Impact of UPS: balancing employee demands and citizen equity

-  UPS introduces an element of defined benefit in the form of assured pension so that employees are ringfenced from the risk and uncertainty of market returns-linked returns. Inflation indexation ensures that the real value of the pension fixed on superannuation is not eroded.
-  UPS allows  choice to  the  employee and  the potential of higher than assured pension. UPS incorporates the demands of assurance regarding pension of the employees while ensuring a fiscally responsible,  funded  and  contributory  pension scheme,  balancing  inter-citizen  and  intergeneration equity.

## UPS in States

The mechanism of UPS has been designed for both Centre and States. However, so far the status of adoption of UPS by the State Government is not known. As  per  some  media  reports,  State  Government  of Maharashtra has shown interest towards implementation of the UPS.

## 7.7 Public Financial Management System(PFMS) :-

As a major initiative  relating to public finance management with focus on good governance through efficient use of public resources with citizen centric focus, Controller General of Accounts has designed, developed and implemented a state of art, web based IT platform Public  Finance  Management  System  (PFMS)  under supervision and guidance of Department of Expenditure. The  system  has  enabled  complete  digitalization  of payment systems in 76 Civil Ministries/Departments for all releases made by the Central Government to the State Government and Implementing Agencies/Beneficiaries/ Vendors etc.

The PFMS provides modules for end-to-end digital payments,  Collection  of  Receipts,  Accounting, Reconciliation and Financial Reporting.  PFMS has also been providing a robust IT platform for more effective cash management in the GoI through "Just in time" transfer of funds and complete tracking of realization of funds from its release to its credit into the bank account of intended beneficiaries.

PFMS being one of the transformative initiative and part of major financial reforms has played a pivotal role  in  revolutionizing  the  financial  administration  of Government of India and also makes a direct and significant contribution to the Digital India Initiative of Government of India

## 7.7.1     Single Nodal Account (SNA) Central:-

Budget provisions  for  a  Centrally  Sponsored Scheme constitutes releases to States, UTs, UTs without legislature and the agencies implementing the scheme. There are some components of the CSS where 100% funding is done by Govt. of India and scheme guidelines have provision of releasing funds directly to Implementing Agencies. DoE vide para 23 of OM dated 23rd March 2021, had given the exemption from notifying SNA and opening an SNA account for releases to those CSS having no State share and where funds are released by the Ministry directly to the Implementing Agency.

Now DoE vide OM dated 8 th  Feb 2023 has deleted para 23 of the DoE's guidelines dated 23 rd  March, 2021. Thus in order to implement SNA system uniformly for a CSS, PFMS was directed to develop 'SNA - Central' module to facilitate the release of CSS funds directly to Central implementing agencies.

Accordingly, SNA - Central module was developed and made live on 23 rd  May 2024. SOP for the same was prepared and circulated to all stakeholders for easy on boarding. The CSNA module is available for Program Divisions and implementing agencies. Ministry will identify the CSS where some components are 100% financed by Govt. of India and scheme guidelines have the provision of release of funds directly to Implementing Agencies and further on board them to CSNA system following the SOP.

Implementation  of  SNA  -  Central  enables implementing agencies to track the utilization of funds till the last mile.

## 7.7.2 e-Bill - End to end digitisation of bills/claims processing:-

In pursuance of the Digital India Initiative of Hon'ble Prime Minister, it was decided to develop a system to enable end to end digital processing of bills and claims from Vendors, suppliers, contractors and all other types of payees of Government. The system was developed in the Public Financial Management System (PFMS) for the use in all Civil Ministries and  Departments. Currently, payments to different types of payees in these Ministries and Departments are done through a mixed system of physical and digital modes. While the payments are done mostly through electronic mode without involvement of any paper instruments like cheques/DDs, the claimants are still  required  to  submit  physical  bills/claims  to  the authorities for scrutiny. With the initiative of e-bill, the complete Payment system has become paperless.

In  the  e-bill  system,  vendors/suppliers/other claimants can digitally upload their bills and the supporting documents through digital signature/e-sign certification for further processing of payments. The system brings about following advantages to the Government payment system:

- i. Convenience to vendors/suppliers/contractors in submitting  their  bills/claims  without  physically approaching the offices.
- ii. Shorter bill payment cycle after delivery of store/ services  as  the  time  taken  in  physical  bill submission shall be truncated.
- iii. Online tracking of the bill position by vendors/ suppliers/contractors.
4. i v . More effective audit trails in the payment system.
5. v . Environmental benefits on account of elimination of paper requirements.
- vi. An  effective  tool  to  facilitate  Government disbursements in the pandemic like situations.

Thus, the e-bill  system  has  great  potential  to further  strengthen  transparency,  accountability,  and efficiency in Government payment system and will prove to be a great citizen centric initiative in Public Finance Management. The processes flow followed in e-bill system is fully compliant to Information Technology Act, 2000. Necessary  approvals  of  Ministry  of  Electronics  and Information Technology (Meity) and UIDAI have been received for Aadhaar based authentication (e-sign).

A Document Management System (DMS) has been made a part of the e- bill system in which all electronic documents (bills, invoices, sanction orders, supporting documents, vouchers, pass orders/return orders etc.) will be stored and can be accessed by various users to view and could also be retrieved at any stage for post facto scrutiny, audit etc.

The e-bill initiative was launched on 2 nd  March, 2022.  It is  proposed to be rolled  out  in  all offices of Ministries/ Departments of Government of India in phases. The system has been implemented in 509 Pay &amp; Accounts Offices (PAOs) of all Civil Ministries/Departments.

ITBA is used as a platform for delivery of taxpayer services such as Grievance Redressal through E-Nivaran portal, passing of orders relating to issuance of refunds, etc. which are carried out by the officers of the Department.

One of the key achievements of ITBA has been the  enablement  of  Faceless Assessments/Appeals/ Penalty. In Faceless scheme, certain legal proceedings under  direct  tax  laws  are  conducted  by  leveraging information technology. Hence, the faceless regime aims to  impart  greater  efficiency,  transparency,  and accountability  in  the  income  tax  proceedings  by eliminating in-person interaction between the taxpayer and the tax officer. ITBA is the platform for use by the tax officers, for implementing the Faceless regime. During the  year  2024-25(upto  30.11.2024),  9636  orders  in respect  of  faceless  assessment,  2,51,835  orders  in respect of faceless penalty and 60,978 orders in respect of faceless appeals have been passed using ITBA.

## ITBA 2.0

ITBA  2.0  has  been  conceptualized  as  an innovative e-Governance project which would succeed ITBA 1.0 utilizing significant technological developments of the past decade to provide improved service delivery to taxpayers. Some of the envisaged improvements in ITBA 2.0 for better taxpayer service delivery are as below: -

- i. Quicker grievance redressal for the taxpayers by bringing  all  the  pendency  (such  e-Nivaran, CPGRAMs, Rectification Requests, Requests for Appeal Order Give Effect, etc.) of a Departmental user at a single navigable page.
- ii. Improved Video Conference facility for faceless schemes.
- iii. Better monitoring and supervision of the work by the supervisory authorities i.e., through integrated action  dashboard,  customized  MIS,  alerts  and notifications.
- iv. Introduction of a Taxpayer Facing Portal in ITBA 2.0, to ensure that the taxpayers can provide their responses to the statutory queries of the officers in a structured manner.
- v. The alerts and notifications that will be generated by ITBA 2.0 for any action to be performed by the user  or  which  requires  his  attention,  will  be customizable. This allows for prioritization of work such as grievance redressal.
- vi. Faster  deployment  of  statutory  changes  in  the Application due to a low code configurable system.
- vii. Using technological advancements such as Single Sign-On, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for providing an ergonomic system to the Departmental Users thereby increasing the user's efficiency.

## VII. CPC TDS

Central Processing Cell-TDS provides a facility for online correction of TDS/TCS statements. Thus, the deductors can correct PANs and other attributes (in case of TAN based Forms 24Q/26Q/27Q/27EQ) and (in case of PAN based Forms 26QB/26QC/26QD/26QE) of the transactions by promptly filing a correction online anytime from anywhere.

Further, CPC-TDS provides online platform for processing  and  issuance  of  Lower/Nil  deduction certificates which are applied through TDS Reconciliation Analysis  and  Correction  Enabling  System  (TRACES) website  in  Form  13/Form  15C/Form  15D/Form 15E, making it an end-to-end faceless online facility, which is a  quantum  leap  in  taxpayer  service  and  which  has reduced the manual work to a minimum level.

CPC  (TDS)  2.0  will  succeed  the  existing CPC(TDS) project and will be based on contemporary technology to deliver taxpayer services CPC(TDS) 2.0 project  would  be  designed  to  accommodate  changed processes and functions related to assessments, cater to the need for enhanced linkages with other modules of the department and increased automation for efficient delivery  of  taxpayer  services.  This  would  entail  redesigning,  re-developing,  and  re-architecting  key components viz., TRACES  Web portal, AO Portal, Processing module, etc. for enhancing conventional TDS/ TCS  functionalities  and  developing  new  services. CPC(TDS) 2.0 will be a completely new application to be built  using  new  technology. The  major  improvements include, inter alia, the following-

- i. End to end E-Proceedings and E-communication for TDS Assessing Officers and for taxpayers
- ii. Faster  processing  of  TDS/TCS statements  and automated  issuance  &amp;  delivery  of  TDS/TCS certificates.
- iii. Integration  with  other  departmental  modules  to enable seamless functioning.
- iv. Improved taxpayer services through an enhanced Integrated Grievance Management System (IGMS).

## 2.7 MEDIA CENTRE (M&amp;TP)

## 2.7.1 Dissemination  of  Information  Related  to Direct Taxes

The Principal  CIT  (Media  &amp; Technical  Policy) oversees the Media Centre, established in August 2006, to  facilitate  the  dissemination  of  public  information concerning direct taxes. Through both print and electronic media, the Media Centre has played a pivotal role in informing the public about key decisions, developments, and achievements. From April 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024, the Centre issued 25 press releases , highlighting important milestones and updates regarding the CBDT and the Income Tax Department.

## 2.7.2 Enhancing Stakeholder  Engagement  via Social Media

In  recent  years,  CBDT  has  expanded  its communication channels to include social media, with a significant presence on X (formerly Twitter). Managed by the  Media  Centre  under  the  supervision  of  the  CIT (M&amp;TP), the official handle, @IncomeTaxIndia, enables two-way communication with taxpayers and stakeholders. The Media Centre  uses  this platform to  disseminate critical information and engage directly with the public.

To  further  streamline  interactions,  an  Online Response and Reputation Management (ORM) system was introduced in July 2019, enabling the Department to identify and address actionable posts and tweets.

## 2.7.3 Performance Metrics:  Tweets, Responses, and Follower Growth

As of now, the @IncomeTaxIndia handle boasts a follower count of 1,540,605 . From April 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024, a total  of 46,708  tweets  and responses were  posted.  These  include  taxpayer education campaigns and responses to public queries.

## 2.7.4 Social  Media  as  a  Tool  for  Compliance Support

During the peak e-filing compliance cycle in July 2024, the Department made extensive use of Twitter's messaging and response features. The handle received 55,679  tweets ,  and  actionable  posts  were  promptly addressed. From April 1, 2024, to July 31, 2024, 33,739 actionable tweets were responded to and assistance was provided ,out of these, 22,282 tickets were raised by the users who connected with the backend team via ORM link/ e-mail. These tickets are related to CPC efiling and ITR issues. Notably, 21,645 tickets (97.14%) were successfully resolved.

## 2.7.5 Process Innovation and Real-Time Support

The adoption of advanced  tools, such  as the Konnect Insight (KI) tool, has significantly improved data collection and collation. This,  coupled with the use of Google Sheets, reduced the Turnaround Time (TAT) from 72 hours to 2-3 hours , with many cases resolved in real-time. Additionally, a dedicated war room, established during  the  peak  e-filing  season,  enabled  real-time grievance resolution in collaboration with the Directorate of Systems.

## 2.7.6 High-Profile Visits and Campaigns

Comprehensive 360-degree media campaigns were  organized  during  visits  by  the  Hon'ble  Vice President, Hon'ble Finance Minister, and the Chairman of CBDT. These events, including building inaugurations, book  launches,  and  valedictory  ceremonies,  were extensively covered with live tweets in coordination with regional teams.

## 2.7.7 Strengthening Regional Outreach via Twitter

Regional offices of the Department, led by their respective Principal Chief Commissioners, operate 19 Twitter  handles  (including  NADT). These handles  are instrumental  in  conducting  localized  outreach  and awareness campaigns. Persistent efforts have led to all regional handles receiving the grey checkmark, ensuring credibility and authenticity.

## 2.7.8 Amplifying Awareness  through  Targeted Campaigns

Focused  social  media  campaigns have  been used to promote key departmental initiatives, such as Special Campaign 4.0. These campaigns leverage the power  of  Twitter  to  maximize  outreach  and  public awareness, ensuring that critical information reaches all stakeholders effectively.

## 3. Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC)

## 3.1 Introduction

The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs or CBIC (erstwhile Central Board of excise &amp; Customs) is a part of the Department of Revenue under the Ministry of Finance, Government of India. It is the apex body for indirect  tax  administration.  It  is  involved  in  policy formulation concerning levy and collection of Customs, Central Excise duties, Central  Goods &amp; Services Tax (CGST) and Inter-state Goods &amp; Services Tax (IGST), prevention of smuggling and administration of matters relating to Customs, Central Excise, CGST, IGST and Narcotics to the extent which is under CBIC's purview. The CBIC also  plays an active  role  in  GST  Council meetings and the associated activities of Law Committee which deliberates on all matters brought before the GST Council. The CBIC constituted under the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963 consists of a Chairman and six Members who are Special Secretaries to the Government of India. The CBIC personnel supervise the functioning of the subordinate formations which includes Directorates and field formations of Customs, GST Commissionerates and Narcotics formations such as Opium factories and the Central Revenues Control Laboratory.

The  field  formations  are  mainly  engaged  in collection of revenue and are spread across the country.

The tax payer's grievances are attended to by these field units of the CBIC on a day to day basis.

The Board is assisted by 19 Directorates who act  as  adjunct  offices  and  assist  the  Board  in  policy formulation. Each Directorate has been assigned with a specific  responsibility.  The  Directorate  General  of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) is the premier intelligence and investigation  agency  which  collects  and  collates intelligence  relating  to  Customs  duty  frauds  and smuggling. Similarly,  the  Directorate  General of  GST Intelligence  is  tasked  with  investigation  of  GST  and Central Excise/ Service Tax matters. Another important directorate  is  the  Directorate  of  Human  Resource Development (DGHRD) which handles all HR matters of CBIC.

After  the  introduction  of  GST  in  2017,  the Directorate of Analytics and Risk Management (DGARM) was created. The DGARM is engaged in data analytics and data mining. The results of the data analytics has helped in detecting large number of fake invoice cases and has helped in augmenting GST collection.

The motto of CBIC is ' Desh Sevarth Kar Sanchay' .

The  activities  and  the  performance  of  the  different Sections/wings and the Directorates working under the CBIC has been summarized.

## 3.2 GOODS AND SERVICE TAX (GST)

## A. Recent  Measures  for  Simplification,  trade facilitation and Ease of Doing Business under GST:

- i. Insertion of Section 128A in CGST Act has been carried out to provide for conditional waiver of interest or penalty or both relating to demands raised under Section 73, for FY 2017-18  to  FY  2019-20  : Considering  the difficulties faced by the taxpayers, during the i nitial  years  of  implementation  of  GST, amendments have been made in the CGST Act, to provide for continued waiver of interest and penalties for demand notices issued under Section 73 of the CGST Act for the fiscal years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, in cases where the  taxpayer  pays  the  full  amount  of  tax demanded in the notice upto 31.03.2025.
- ii. Reduction of  Government Litigation  by Fixing monetary  limits for filing appeals under GST .The CBIC has issued Circular No. 207/01/2024-GST  dated  26.06.2024  to prescribe monetary limits, subject to certain exclusions, for filing of appeals in GST by the department before  GST Appellate Tribunal, High  Court,  and  Supreme  Court,  to  reduce government litigation.
- iii. Amendment in Section 107 and Section 112 of CGST Act for reducing the amount of predeposit  required to  be paid  for  filing  of appeals under GST: Provisions have been

(Amount in Rs. crore)

made for reducing the amount of pre-deposit for filing of appeals under GST to ease cash flow  and  working  capital  blockage  for  the taxpayers.  The  maximum  amount for filing appeal with the appellate authority has been reduced from Rs. 25 crores CGST and Rs. 25 crores SGST to Rs. 20 crores CGST and Rs. 20 crores SGST. Further, the amount of predeposit  for  filing  appeal  with  the Appellate Tribunal has been reduced from 20% with a maximum amount of Rs. 50 crores CGST and Rs. 50 crores SGST to 10 % with a maximum of  Rs.  20  crores  CGST  and  Rs.  20  crores SGST

- iv. Reduction in rate of TCS to be collected by the ECOs for supplies being made through them: Electronic  Commerce  Operators (ECOs) are required to collect Tax Collected at Source (TCS) on net taxable supplies under Section 52(1) of the CGST Act. The Central Government has issued Notification No. 15/ 2024-Central Tax dated 10.07.2024 (notified w.e.f. 10.07.2024), Notification No. 01/2024Union Territory Tax dated 10.07.2024 (notified w.e.f. 10.07.2024) &amp; Notification No. 01/2024Integrated Tax dated 10.07.2024 (notified w.e.f. 10.07.2024)  to  reduce  the  TCS  rate  from present  1%  (0.5%  CGST  +  0.5%  SGST/ UTGST, or 1% IGST) to 0.5 % (0.25% CGST + 0.25% SGST/UTGST, or 0.5% IGST), to ease the financial burden on the suppliers making supplies through such ECOs.

- v. Change in due date for filing of return in FORM GSTR-4 for composition taxpayers from 30th April to 30th June: Amendments have been done in clause (ii) of sub-rule (1) of Rule 62 of CGST Rules,  2017 and  FORM GSTR-4 to extend the due date for filing of return  in  FORM  GSTR-4  for  composition taxpayers from 30th April to 30th June following the end of the financial year. This will apply for returns for the financial year 2024-25 onwards. The  same  would  give  more  time  to  the taxpayers who opt to pay tax under composition levy to furnish the said return.
- vi. Amendments of Section 16(4) of CGST Act, to be made effective from July 1st, 2017,to relax condition of section 16(4) of the CGST Act  in respect  of  initial years  of implementation of GST, i.e. financial years 2017-18,  2018-19,  2019-20  and  2020-21: Considering  the  difficulties  faced  by  the taxpayers  during  the  initial  years  of i mplementation  of  GST,  based  on  the recommendations  of  the  GST  Council, retrospective amendment has been made in Section 16(4) of CGST Act  to relax the time limit to avail input tax credit in respect of any invoice or debit note under Section 16(4) of CGST Act, through any GSTR 3B return filed upto 30.11.2021 for the financial years 201718, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21, may be deemed to be 30.11.2021. This would benefit a large number of taxpayers, especially smaller ones,  who could not file  returns  in  a  timely manner in  the initial  years  of  GST,  due  to various reasons by which time, the time limit for availment of Input tax credit, under section 16(4) of CGST Act had already expired, which has led to issuance of demands denying them the benefit of input tax credit.
- vii. Amendment of Rule 88B of CGST Rules, 2017 in respect of interest under Section 50 of CGST Act on delayed filing of returns, in  cases  where  the  credit  is  available  in Electronic Cash Ledger (ECL) on the due date of filing the said return :-The Central Government has issued Notification No. 12/ 2024-Central  Tax  dated  10.07.2024  for amendment in rule 88B (w.e.f. 10.07.2024) of CGST Rules to provide that an amount which is available in the Electronic Cash Ledger on the due date of filing of return in FORM GSTR3B, and is debited while filing the said return, shall not be included while calculating interest under section 50 of the CGST Act in respect of delayed filing of the said return. This will reduce interest burden on such taxpayers.
- viii. Provision  of  new  optional  facility  for taxpayers to amend the details in GSTR-1: The Central Government has provided for a new optional facility by way of FORM GSTR1A (w.e.f. 10.07.2024) to facilitate the taxpayers to amend the details in FORM GSTR-1 for a tax period and/ or to declare additional details, if any, before filing of return in FORM GSTR3B for the said tax period. This will facilitate taxpayer to add any particulars of supply of the current tax period missed out in reporting in FORM GSTR-1 of the said tax period or to amend any particulars already declared  in FORM GSTR-1 of the  current tax  period (including those declared in IFF, for the first and second months of a quarter, if any, for quarterly  taxpayers),  to  ensure  that  correct liability is auto-populated in FORM GSTR-3B.
- ix. A consolidated guidelines dated 30.03.2024 was issued to all CGST Zones in respect of Ease of Doing Business(EODB) to be followed during investigations of cases against regular taxpayers.
- x. Besides, based on the recommendations of the GST Council, a large number of notifications and circulars have been issued on contentious issues, so as to avoid legal disputes.

## 4.2 Directorate of Enforcement

## 4.2.1 Introduction

4.2.1.1 The  Directorate  of  Enforcement  (ED)  is  the premier law enforcement agency of the Government of India which has been entrusted with the administration and enforcement of the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA), Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) and the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018 (FEOA). ED is the nodal agency for collection of intelligence,  carrying  out  research  and  analysis  and conducting  financial  investigation  for  cases  involving money-laundering, bank frauds, financial scams, foreign exchange violations etc. Under the provisions of PMLA, the officers of ED investigate and prosecute the persons involved in  money-laundering, attach the proceeds of crime  and  carry  out  international  cooperation  with competent authorities in foreign jurisdictions including recovery of assets stashed abroad and extradition of fugitives. ED is also entrusted with the responsibility to investigate, adjudicate and impose penalty if any person violates the provisions of FEMA and launch prosecution in appropriate cases.

4.2.1.2 In  the  recent  past,  the  work  of  Directorate  of Enforcement  has  increased  considerably  both qualitatively  and  quantitatively.  Investigations  have commenced in several high-profile cases and cases with International ramifications with positive results in terms of  attachment  and  confiscation  of  proceeds  of  crime related  to  bank  fraud,  corruption,  drugs  &amp;  human trafficking and terror financing etc. Further, with consistent efforts, ED has secured conviction and confiscation in 07 cases where trial has been concluded.

## 4.2.2 Functioning of the Directorate

4.2.2.1 The  primary  function  of  the  Directorate  of Enforcement is administration and enforcement of the Prevention  of  Money-Laundering Act, 2002  including investigation into the offence of money-laundering, filing of prosecution complaint before the Special Court against the accused, attachment and confiscation of property involved in money-laundering, carrying out international cooperation  with  competent  authorities  in  foreign jurisdictions ensuring that the accused persons do not enjoy the proceeds of crime. For collecting information and  investigating  money-laundering  (ML)  offences, Regional Offices/Zonal office/Sub-zonal of ED has been setup across various cities throughout the country. ED collect information regarding commission of predicate offence  related  to  offence  of  ML  from  the  following sources:

- a) ML-I  and  ML-II  Reports :  These  are  reports provided by Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) that  provide  critical  insights  into  predicate offences  related  to  ML  activities  and  related offenses.
- b) Crime  and  Criminal  Tracking  Network  &amp; Systems (CCTNS): This  national  database enables law enforcement agencies to share and access information about crimes and criminals, facilitating better tracking and investigation.
- c) Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS): Similar  to CCTNS, this  system  allows for  the seamless  exchange  of  information  among various criminal justice stakeholders, enhancing the investigative process.
- d) CBI portal: CBI regularly uploads branch-wise copy of FIRs registered by the agency  on its public website.
- e) Other Information from LEAs: This may include any additional intelligence or data that can aid in investigations  provided  by  law  enforcement agencies either suo-moto or on request of the Directorate.
- f) Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs)  and Operational Analysis (OA) Reports: STRs are reports submitted by financial institutions to FIU to  notify  authorities  of  suspicious transactions that may indicate ML, while operational analysis reports are multiple STRs having similar modus operandi clubbed  into a single STR after analysis by FIU and thus, OA provides deeper analysis.
- g) Egmont Secure  Web  (ESW): Information gathered from ESW can provide critical leads either to initiate an ML investigation or in ongoing ML investigations.
- h) Intelligence Inputs or Complaints from Private Individuals: Tips or complaints received from the public can be valuable in identifying potential ML activities.
- i) Open-Source Information: This includes data available from media reports, online articles, and other  publicly  accessible  sources  that  may provide insights into potential ML activities.
- j) Information  from Any  Other  Source: This encompasses any additional data that may be relevant, regardless of its origin.

On receipt of the reference or information from any  of  the  above  sources  and  after  making  certain preliminary verification, ED records a case and initiates investigation (Enforcement Case Information Report or the ECIR) following a risk based approach taking into consideration factors such as materiality of the offence, transnational nature of the crime, complexity of the case, the larger public interest and the availability of resources. Identification and quantification of proceeds of crime and involvement of person/entities in any process or activity connected with proceeds of crime are main requirements for proving offence of money-laundering as well as for punishment for money laundering offence.

4.2.2.2

The Directorate of Enforcement is also entrusted with  the  implementation  of  the  Foreign  Exchange Management Act, 1999 whose object is to consolidate and  amend the  law relating  to  foreign  exchange  for facilitating external trade and payments and for promoting the  orderly  development  and  maintenance  of  foreign exchange resources. Information about possible FEMA violations is received from human intelligence resources and various departments viz. (i) the Reserve Bank of India regarding  export  outstanding  statements  (XOS statement), non-repatriation of foreign exchange, pending Bills of entries, contraventions pertaining to FDI, list of Authorized Dealer-I &amp; II (AD-I &amp; AD-II) who contravene the  provisions  of  FEMA;  (ii)  Banks  regarding contravention of FEMA including through mis-utilization of foreign exchange/advance payments for imports, nonrealization of export proceeds and violation of norms of NRE/NRO/FCNR accounts; (iii) Custom authorities and Income Tax Authorities pertaining to over/under voicing of exports/imports, smuggling of foreign currency, illegal gold imports, violation of baggage rules etc.; (iv) SEBI regarding violation of FDI norms pertaining to FEMA by foreign  investors  etc.;  (v)  State  authorities  regarding purchase of agricultural land by foreigners etc. &amp; (vi) Income  Tax  Authorities  regarding  acquisition  of undisclosed foreign assets under Black Money Act or otherwise  which  invites  action  under  section  37A  of FEMA. Further, the following categories of cases under FEMA are investigated by this Directorate as under:

- a) Under-invoicing of exports and over-invoicing of imports and other forms of invoice manipulation;
- b) Non repatriation  of  the  proceeds  of  exported goods;
- c) Siphoning  off  of  foreign  exchange  against fictitious and bogus imports;
- d) Illegal acquisition of foreign exchange through Hawala;
- e) Restriction  in  acquisition  and  transfer  of agricultural  land  or  farm  house  or  plantation property by persons resident outside India and restriction on acquisition of immovable property by nationals of certain countries;
- f) Remittances of Non-resident Indians other than through normal banking channels i.e. through compensatory payments;
- g) Violation  of  norms  related  to  GDRs,  Ecommerce, Foreign Direct Investment etc.;

Acquisition of foreign currency illegally by Indian nationals;

- Unauthorized maintenance of accounts in foreign countries including accounts revealed through Panama, Paradise, Pandora papers etc &amp;
- k) Illegal  holding  of  foreign  exchange,  foreign security or immovable property outside India.

Accordingly, ED investigates and issues Show Cause Notices (SCN) in cases where the allegations of contravention of provisions under FEMA are observed. These SCNs upon adjudication results in imposition of penalty  as  well  as  confiscation  of  currency/property involved.

4.2.2.3 The Directorate of Enforcement has also been entrusted  with  the  implementation  of  the  Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018. The FEOA provides for the measures to deter the fugitive economic offenders from evading the process of law in India by staying outside the  jurisdiction  of  Indian  Courts  and  to  preserve  the sanctity of the rule of law in India. Action under the said Act can be initiated against economic offenders who have left India so as to avoid criminal prosecution or who, being abroad,  refuse  to  return  to  India  to  face  criminal prosecution and where the total amount involved in the economic offence is more than Rs. 100 crore.

## 4.2.4 Offence of Money Laundering

4.2.4.1 Section 3 of the PMLA criminalizes the offence of money-laundering related to a wide range of criminal offences listed  in  the  schedule  to  the  PMLA.  These offences include participation in an organized criminal group and racketeering, terrorism and terrorist financing, illicit  trafficking  in  narcotics  drugs  and  psychotropic substances,  illegal  human  trafficking,  illicit  arms trafficking, illicit trafficking in stolen goods, corruption and bribery,  fraud,  counterfeiting  and  piracy  of  products, environmental crimes, kidnapping, robbery, smuggling, extortion, forgery, piracy and insider trading and market manipulation. These offences listed in the schedule are called 'predicate offences' and section 3 of the PMLA states that whoever is directly or indirectly involved or associated with any process or activity connected with 'proceeds of crime' related to these criminal activity will be guilty of the offence of money-laundering and is liable for punishment with rigorous imprisonment of three to ten years under section 4 of the PMLA.

4.2.4.2 It is not necessary that for committing an offence of  money-laundering,  the  person  concerned  should project  or  claim  the  proceeds  of  crime  as  untainted property, it is enough if he is directly or indirectly involved in any process of activity connected with the proceeds of crime including its concealment, possession, acquisition

or  use.  Thus,  the  definition  of  the  offence  of  moneylaundering is in full compliance with Article 3(1)(b) and 3(1)(c) of the Vienna Convention and Article 6(1) of the Palermo Convention.

## 4.2.5 Attachment and Confiscation

4.2.5.1 Section 5 of the PMLA provides that where the Director, Directorate of Enforcement, or any other officer not below the rank of Deputy Director authorized by him, has reason to believe (the reason for such belief to be recorded  in  writing),  on  the  basis  of  material  in  his possession, that (a) any person is in possession of any proceeds of crime and (b) such proceeds of crime are likely to be concealed, transferred or dealt with in any manner which may result in frustrating any proceedings relating to confiscation of such proceeds of crime, he may, by order in writing, provisionally attach such property for a period not exceeding 180 days from the date of the order.

4.2.5.2 Section 17 of the PMLA gives power to Director, Directorate of Enforcement, or any other officer authorized by him not below the rank of Deputy Director, to carry out search and seizure operation and seize any record or property found during the search. If it is not practicable to seize such record or property, the officer concerned may make an order to freeze the property prohibiting its transfer. Section 18  of the PMLA gives powers to the officers of Directorate of Enforcement to search a person and seize any property. In the case of seizure/freezing under sections 17 and 18 of the PMLA, the authorities concerned are required to make an application to the Adjudicating Authority  for  retention  of  such  record  or property or for continuing the order of freezing.

4.2.5.3 The Adjudicating Authority is a quasi-judicial body comprising of a Chairperson and two other members. On receipt of a complaint under sections 5 or 17 or 18 of the PMLA, the Adjudicating Authority decides after hearing all  parties  that  the  property  is  involved  in  moneylaundering or not. The attachment/freezing order continue during the investigation for a period not exceeding 365 days or during the pendency of the proceeding related to any offence under the PMLA before a Court, including foreign  Courts,  when  confirmed  by  the Adjudicating Authority.  Thus,  after  the  order  of  the  adjudicating authority, the attachment/freezing continues during the investigation  and  will  also  continue  after  filing  of  a prosecution complaint till the matter is finally decided by the Court.

4.2.5.4 The order of confiscation is passed by the Special Court under section 8(5) of the PMLA after conclusion of the trial for the offence of money-laundering and all rights and title in the property vest absolutely in the Central Government free from all encumbrances. However, after the  confirmation  of  the  attachment/freezing  by  the

Adjudicating Authority, a quasi-judicial body, it is provided in  section  8(4)  of  the  PMLA  that  the  officers  of  the Directorate of Enforcement will take possession of the property attached and thus it is ensured that the offenders do  not  enjoy  the  'proceeds  of  crime'.  Thus,  after confirmation of attachment/freezing by the Adjudicating Authority,  it  no  longer  remains  only  a  'provisional measure' as the property is not available to the criminals.

4.2.5.5 Any  person  aggrieved  with  the  order  of Adjudicating Authority,  including  the  officers  of  the Directorate of Enforcement, can file an appeal within 45 days before the Appellate Tribunal, another quasi-judicial authority under section 26 of the PMLA and the Appellate Tribunal  after  giving  the  parties  to  the  appeal  an opportunity of being heard may pass such orders thereon as it thinks fit, confirming, modifying or setting aside the order appealed against. Any person aggrieved with the order of Appellate Tribunal may file an appeal to the High Court within 60 days on any question of law or fact arising out of such order.

## 4.2.6 Investigation, Prosecution and Conviction

4.2.6.1 Under the PMLA, the officers of the Directorate of Enforcement have wide range of powers to investigate the  offence  of  money-laundering  and  for  attachment/ freezing and confiscating the proceeds of crime. These include powers of summons, survey, search and seizure, search of persons, arrest etc. The officers of various other departments such as officers of CBIC, CBDT, police, RBI, SEBI, IRDAI etc. are empowered and required to assist the  officers  of  the  Directorate  of  Enforcement  in  the enforcement of PMLA.

4.2.6.2 After  registering  the  complaint,  at  the  first instance,  the  officers  of  Directorate  of  Enforcement identify, quantify and trace the 'proceeds of crime'. They also collect the evidence relating to the commencement of  the  offence,  which  may  comprise  of  information received  from  predicate  agency  on  parallel  financial investigation,  examination  of  accused,  other  persons associated with the offence and third parties, reduction of  their  statement  in  writing,  carrying  out  survey  and search  etc.  They  provisionally  attach  the  properties identified as 'proceeds of  crime' and file a complaint before the Adjudicating Authority. In appropriate cases, joint  investigation  in  collaboration  with  the  predicate agency is also conducted.

4.2.6.3 After carrying out the necessary investigation, the Directorate  of  Enforcement  also  file  a  Prosecution Complaint before the Special Courts constituted under section 43 of the PMLA, who takes cognizance of the offence of money-laundering committed under section 3 of the PMLA. After trial in the Special Court, the accused is convicted and is punished in accordance with section 4 of the PMLA.

## 4.2.7 International Cooperation

4.2.7.1 When proceeds of crime related  to  offence committed in India, is transferred in foreign jurisdictions, or when accused person(s) has escaped from India, after committing the offence of money-laundering or part of it or  the  offence  itself  has  been  committed  outside  the country or the witnesses and other material evidence are available in another country, it may be necessary to gather information or conduct formal investigation abroad.

57  of  the  PMLA  although  under  the  MLAT  or  the multilateral  treaties,  the  requests  need  not  be  routed through the Courts.

- 4.2.7.3 If an order of attachment/freezing/confiscation has been issued by  the  officers  of  the  Directorate  of Enforcement and the said property is suspected to be in a foreign jurisdiction, the Special Court may issue a letter of  request  to  a  court  or  an  authority  in  the  foreign jurisdiction for execution of such order.

4.2.7.2 Generally, the basis for seeking Mutual Legal Assistance from a Contracting State is the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in Criminal Matters (MLAT). As of now, India has signed MLAT with 45 countries. Mutual Legal Assistance can also be sought on the basis Multilateral Treaties,  such  as,  United  Nation  Convention  against Corruption  (UNCAC) or  United Nation Convention on Transnational Organized Crime (UNCTOC). Where there is no such treaty the request can be made on the basis of mutual assurance of reciprocity. These requests are normally made through the Special Courts under section

4.2.7.4 The Directorate of Enforcement also provides assistance to foreign jurisdictions and investigates the offence of money-laundering by carrying out necessary inquiries if a request is received from a Court or authority in the said foreign jurisdiction. It may also attach, seize, freeze,  or  confiscate  the  property  in  India  derived  or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of an offence under the corresponding law committed  in  the  foreign  jurisdiction  if  a  request  is received from a Court or authority in the said foreign jurisdiction.

## Case study

ED received a Letter of Request from US authorities, perusal of which revealed that an Indian national, Mr. A  was  operating  a sophisticated drug trafficking operation via  dark  web marketplaces.  The  operation  spanned  from  mid-2012  to  July  2017.  He  created  vendor marketing sites on dark web marketplaces, such as Silk Road, Alpha Bay, Hansa, and others, to sell controlled substances, including fentanyl, LSD, ecstasy, Xanax, Ketamine, and Tramadol. Customers ordered controlled substances from Mr. A using the vendor sites and payment was made  in  cryptocurrency.  He  then  personally  shipped  or  arranged  the  shipment  of  controlled substances from Europe to the United States through U.S. mail or other shipping services.

Investigation  by  the  Drug  Enforcement  Administration  (DEA),  IRS  Criminal  Investigation (IRS:CI), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) revealed  that  Mr.  A  laundered  around  $150  millions  of  drug  proceeds  into  cryptocurrency accounts.  He  was  arrested  in  London  in  April  2019  and  extradited  to  the  U.S.  in  2023.  He pleaded  guilty  to  conspiracy  to  distribute  controlled  substances  and  conspiracy  to  commit money  laundering.  He  faced  an  agreed-upon  sentence  of  eight  years  in  prison,  pending  a sentencing date.

Investigation further revealed brother of Mr. A, Mr. B was also involved in the operation of the International Drug Trafficking group and he has received laundered drug trafficking proceeds in form of crypto currency. US authorities also believed that digital evidence of the crime, along with devices and/ or passwords that control access to drug trafficking proceeds in the form of crypto  currency,  are  present  at  the  residence  of  Mr.  B  in  India.  Therefore,  US  authorities requested for search and seizure operations to be conducted at the address of Mr. B as well as to conduct interview of Mr. B. They also requested if investigating officers from USA could be part of the same.

To this investigation under provisions of PMLA has been initiated by ED. Investigations revealed that  Mr.  A,  Mr.  B  and  their  father  Mr.  C  have  received  total  foreign  inward  remittance  of  Rs. 5,54,41,420/-  through  PayPal.  During  investigation  by  ED,  search  was  conducted  at  the residence of Mr. B wherein 268.22 Bitcoins were seized and taken into possession. Mr. B was arrested by ED for committing the offence of money-laundering. Investigation to trace further proceeds of crime is under progress.

## 4.2.9 Special Focus on Terror Financing

4.2.9.1 The Directorate of Enforcement gives special focus  on  investigation  of  terror  financing  cases. The terrorism  cases  under  UAPA  are  investigated  and prosecuted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) under  the  NIA Act,  2008.  However,  the  State  Police Authorities also  investigate the terrorism cases under UAPA and also under various provisions of the IPC.

4.2.9.2 The  focus  of  investigation  by  the  Police Authorities are normally on criminal investigation such as from where the arms have been received, how the conspiracy has been hatched, who was the mastermind, what  was  the  plot,  what  was  the  motive,  who  were involved etc.

4.2.9.3 The Directorate of Enforcement, after a reference is  made to it by the  police authorities, carries  out the financial investigation, including from where the funds have been received, how the funds were layered into the banking channels, and if not through banking channels, whether it was from Hawala or Barter Trade or Trade Based Money Laundering. It also investigates, how and to whom the funds were distributed and if the funds have been invested in some property, whether the property still exist or is liquidated. Once the property is identified, the Directorate  of  Enforcement  provisionally  attaches  the property and then takes possession after confirmation by the Adjudicating Authority. If the property is liquidated, equivalent amount of property, whether in India or abroad, is attached.

4.2.9.4 During investigation  of cases  related to terror financing by ED, it has been found that the terrorists use a number of methods for funding including the following:

-  Banking  channels  by  receipt  of  foreign remittances
-  Authorized  money  transfer  services  such  as Western Union
-  Hawala Payments
-  Donations to NPOs/Social Welfare Organizations
-  Barter Trade
-  Fake Indian Currency Notes

4.2.9.5 It may be noted that Barter Trade was allowed between India and Pak Occupied Kashmir, across the Line of Control. This mode of trade was being misused by  the  Pakistan  based  elements  for  illegal  inflow  of

narcotics,  weapons  and  Fake  Indian  Currency  Notes. Huge seizures  of narcotics  have  been  affected  from concealments in the trucks being used in the name of trade across LOC. Besides, invoice manipulation was being  used  for  generating  cash  for  terror  funding. Therefore, the Barter Trade has been suspended by the Government of India, pending strict regulatory mechanism in April, 2019.

4.2.9.6 In terror financing cases, ED has a very important role  both  in  tracing  the  proceeds  of  crime  and  its laundering by the terrorists. ED  not  only attaches  the Proceeds of Crime and takes possession of the same but also files Prosecution Complaints against the terror accused under the PMLA.

4.2.9.7 ED  has  taken  strict  action  against  terrorist activities by way of registering several cases related to terror  funding  against  anti-national  elements  and intensified money laundering investigation to trace and deter the terror funding leading to unearthing of Proceeds of  Crime (PoC) to the tune of more than Rs. 1274.89 Crore  (approx.).  Out  of  the  identified  PoC,  assets amounting to Rs. 1115.22  crore (approx.)  have been attached by this  Directorate.  The  attached  properties include both movable and immovable properties of Rs. 912.22 crore (approx.) in India and Rs. 203 crore (approx.) in  abroad.  In one of  the  case, the  accused  has been declared  as  Fugitive  Economic  Offender  and  the properties worth Rs. 97.99 Crore have been confiscated under the provisions of Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018  (FEOA). A  total  of  53  prosecution  complaints (Charge-sheets) including 17 Supplementary PCs have been filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 and 09 accused have been convicted in 04 cases by PMLA Special Court. Further, 13 accused have been declared Proclaimed Offender and 03 accused have been declared  Fugitive  Economic  Offender  by  the  Special Courts. Case study on one such important case taken for investigation by the ED is provided in the box below.

## Case Study

A case relating to narco-terrorism module of banned terrorist outfit, Hijbul Mujahideen (HM), has been recorded for investigation under the provisions of the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002 on the basis of FIR registered Jammu and Kashmir Police that a network of Narco- Terror financing comprising other accused persons, was involved in cross border drugs smuggling and terror funding out of the money generated from the sale of the drugs.

Investigation  under  the  PMLA  has  revealed  a  network  of  collusion  of  drug  smuggling  and terrorism.  The  funds,  derived  out  of  cross  border  drug  smuggling  and  selling,  in  the  form  of Proceeds  of  Crime,  were  laundered  via  camouflaging  the  same  under  the  business  of  sale purchase of second-hand cars. In the next stage, the same were routed into the hands of active terrorists for the sole purpose of subversive activities. The involvements of various entities and persons, like Punjab based drug peddlers, Kashmir based religious teachers, and businessmen, were  found in the logistical  chain  to  transport  and  selling  the  cross  border  smuggled  drugs  to areas around Jammu and Kashmir, like Punjab etc. under the guise of apple trade.

The  sale  proceeds  of  the  drugs  were  brought  back  and  channelized  into  bank  accounts  as projected proceeds of business sale -purchase of second-hand cars, while also providing money for  funding  the  subversive  activities  of  HM  The  investigation  had  also  unearthed  the  role  of erstwhile active terrorists, now leading civil life, into facilitating movement of cash into the hands of active terrorists. The transaction profiling of the bank accounts spread across various banks in the  case  revealed  huge  cash  deposits  obtained  via  drugs  sales,  routed  through  multiple suspected interconnected transactions, disguising the actual source and nature of funds, into the hands of the active terrorists.

Unlike traditional methods, this network employed a novel approach to laundering drug proceeds. Instead of relying on traditional hawala channels or  cross border trade,  the accused  utilized a seemingly legitimate business - the sale  and purchase of second-hand cars - to disguise the illicit origin of the funds. The accused masterfully exploited a legitimate business - the car trade to  launder  drug  proceeds  having  less  reporting  to  escape  the  eyes  of  the  law  enforcement agencies

In this case, about Rs. 1.57 crore lying in bank account of accused persons, and about Rs. 94 lakhs, infused into terrorist activities were identified as Proceeds of Crime. Further, 03 persons have been arrested in this case and prosecution complaint has been filed on 14.09.2024 wherein the  court  took  cognizance  of  the  offence  of  money  laundering  on  14.09.2024  and  proceeded against accused persons.

4.2.9.8 Action against insurgent groups in the North-East Region:  In order to put a curb on the funding of insurgency activities in the North-East Region, the Directorate has taken up several investigations under the provisions of PMLA against some of the prominent extremist groups such as NSCN (IM), NSCN (K), Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel Garolsa Faction).

4.2.10 Proactive Steps taken by ED in other key areas of money laundering are as follows:

4.2.9.9 Action against Naxal funding in Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh: Strict actions under PMLA have been taken  against  LWEs  active  in  Bihar,  Jharkhand  &amp; Chhattisgarh leading to attachment of properties and filing of  Prosecution  Complaints  in  several  cases. As  on 31.12.2024, PoC amounting to Rs. 18 crore (approx.) has been identified in Naxal/LWE related cases out of which, PoC amounting to Rs. 10.67 crore stands attached in 16 different PAOs. Further, 13 Prosecution Complaints have been filed in Naxal/LWE related cases.

(i) Cyber Fraud: The  advent  of  technology  and growing access of internet has led to innovations and economic growth but at the same time its vulnerability has also been explored by criminals to perpetrate crime. Thus, in whole world including India there has been sharp increase in cyber frauds. The virtual currency has been widely used by criminals to transfer proceeds of crime to foreign jurisdictions without coming under the radar of government agencies. The cyber fraudsters have not only targeted the resourceful people but also the common and poor people. The Directorate has taken vigilant steps in tackling the threat of money-laundering through Cyber Crime and Crypto assets related cases by tracing and attaching/seizing/freezing proceeds of crime. Case study on one such important case taken for investigation by the ED is provided in the box below.

A  cyber  investment  scam  cum  digital  arrest  scam  case  has  been  recorded  for  investigation under the provisions of the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002 on the basis of various FIRs  registered  by  multiple  Law  Enforcement  Agencies  across  India  alleging  that  some unknown  cyber  fraudsters  enticed  innocent  individuals  into  their  trap  by  luring  them  with schemes involving fake IPO allotments and stock market investments through fraudulent apps, promising high returns. Further, some victims were manipulated under the guise of a fake arrest by  Customs  and  the  CBI,  ultimately  making  them  transfer  huge  funds  to  various  shell companies under fake 'fund regularization process'.

Investigation under the PMLA has revealed huge network of cyber scams in India, involving fake stock market investments and digital arrest schemes executed primarily through social media platforms  like  Facebook,  Instagram,  WhatsApp,  and  Telegram.  Known  as  " pig-butchering " scams, stock market investment scams entice victims with promises of high returns, using fake websites and misleading WhatsApp groups that appear connected to reputable financial firms. Scammers  establish  credibility  through  fake  ads  and  fabricated  success  stories,  ultimately leading victims to invest significant amounts. The digital arrest scams involve fraudsters posing as  law  enforcement  officials,  intimidating  victims  into  transferring  their  savings  by  fabricating scenarios that suggest illegal involvement of the victim.

In the instant case, to facilitate the acquisition and laundering of proceeds from cybercrimes, the scammers  have  created  24  shell  companies  in  states  such  as  Tamil  Nadu,  Karnataka,  etc. These  shell  companies,  registered  mainly  at  the  addresses  of  coworking  spaces  (where  no actual business presence exists), have used fake bank statements in filings before Registrar of Companies as proof of  commencement of business of these companies. In addition to these shell  companies,  scammers  have  operated  through  mule  accounts  to  transfer  and  conceal Proceeds of Crime (PoC) generated from Cybercrimes. The proceeds are ultimately converted into cryptocurrency and transferred abroad.

Investigation have revealed that certain individuals residing outside India (mainly in Laos, Hong Kong and Thailand) orchestrated a sophisticated cyber fraud and money laundering operation, with the active assistance of their associates located in India to target numerous victims. These overseas  scammers  have  coordinated  with  individuals  in  India  to  create  digital  signatures, establish shell companies, and serve as dummy Directors to open bank accounts, using fake documents sent via WhatsApp. In  this case, searches have been  conducted  on 19 premises which led to seizure of various incriminating documents, electronic devices and freezing of Rs. 2.81  crore  lying  in  bank  account.  Further,  08  persons  have  been  arrested  in  this  case  and prosecution complaints have been filed on 10.10.2024.

- (ii) Human Trafficking: Human trafficking is one of the most significant human right issue in India. Human trafficking  victims are mostly  bonded labours working more than 12 hours a day in brick kilns, stone quarries,

factories or girls put in forced sex  rackets or humans trafficked to foreign countries in lure of greener pastures. Case study  on  two  such  important  cases  taken  for investigation by the ED is provided in the box below.

## Case Study 1

A case of human trafficking was initiated on the basis of FIR dated June 4, 2024, registered by Ranchi  Police  under  Sections  420,  467,  468,  471,  and  34  of  the  IPC,  Section  12  of  the Passports  Act,  and  Section  14-A  of  the  Foreigners  Act.  As  per  the  FIR,  a  21-year-old Bangladeshi national was illegally brought to Kolkata on May 31, 2024, by one Ms. X and one Ms. Y under the guise of providing work. She was later taken to Ranchi, housed at Bali Resort, and subsequently moved  to an  apartment with other Bangladeshi girls, reportedly for prostitution. On June 3, 2024, the complainant managed to escape and reported the matter to the police. On June 4, 2024, at 3:30 PM, police raided Bali Resort and found three girls, out of which, two girls were Bangladeshi nationals. The rooms were booked by Ms. X, and searches unearthed  use  of  fake  Aadhaar  cards  by  them.  During  course  of  investigation  under  PMLA, 2002, searches have been conducted at 17 premises in West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar on 12.11.2024. The searches led to the recovery and seizure of several fake Aadhaar cards, arms, jewelry, fake passport and other incriminating items. Moreover, four persons have been arrested so far. Further investigation is under progress.

## Case Study 2

In another case of human trafficking, investigation under PMLA have been initiated on the basis of  FIR  dated  14.01.2023  registered  by  Ahmedabad  Police  after  a  family  of  04  persons  was found dead on the Canada-US border on 19.01.2022. Investigations under PMLA revealed that the  individuals  desirous  of  immigrating  to  USA  are  approached  by  agents,  who  arranged admission  of  such  individuals  in  the  Canadian  Colleges.  On  the  basis  of  such  admissions, Student Visa and other documents were issued and the individuals travel to Canada in the guise of  students.  However,  upon  reaching  Canada  the  individuals  instead  of  joining  the  Canadian Colleges, illegally crossed the US-Canada Border and reach USA. The accused were charging huge amount of Rs. 55 to 60 Lakh per person for the same. Investigation, so far, has revealed that the arrangements for 11 Indian National to immigrate into USA illegally in the instant case were done by Fenil Patel in Canada. To gather evidences, so far searches have conducted at 35  premises  which  led  to  seizure  of  cash  amounting  to  Rs  92 lakhs,  04  luxury  vehicles  and various other incriminating documents. Further investigation is under progress.

- (iii) Corruption: Corruption is one of the most chronic problems faced by India which endangers India's socioeconomic, political and development aspirations. ED has been  taking  several  money-laundering  cases  with predicate offences of corruption and intends to mitigate

the same with effective money-laundering investigation by  preventing  the  money-launderers  from  enjoying proceeds of crime. Case study on one such important case taken for investigation by the ED is provided in the box below.

## 4.9.1 The Appellate Tribunal under SAFEMA

4.9.1.1 The Appellate Tribunal  has  been  constituted under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976 (SAFEMA). It started functioning w.e.f. 03.01.1977. It hears the appeals files against the orders of Competent Authority under SAFEM/ NDPS Acts, Adjudicating Authority under PMLA, FEMA and Prohibition  of  Benami  Property  Transactions Act 1988.

4.9.1.2 The Appellate Tribunal is located at New Delhi. It consists of a Chairman (who is, or has been a Judge of the Supreme Court or Chief Justice of a High Court) and four Members. The four members are appointed from among the officers of the Central Government who have held the post of Additional Secretary to the Government of  India  or  any  equivalent  or  higher  post  and  have performed judicial, quasi-judicial or adjudicating function for three years.

4.9.1.3 The appeals  and  allied  petitions  under  the aforesaid  acts  are  disposed  of  by  the  Benches  as constituted as the Chairman may deem fit. During the period 01.04.2024 to 30.11.2024, a total of 2141 Appeals (1545 in PMLA, 216 in NDPSA, 01 in SAFEMA, 73 in FEMA and 306 in PBPT) were received during the said period. A total of 1716 appeals (1213 in PMLA, 89 in NDPSA, 29 in SAFEMA, 291 in FEMA and 94 in PBPT) were disposed of during the said period. However, with proper  adjudication  and  change  of  the  roaster  and benches, all the appeals filed till 2003 were disposed off reducing the average of appeals drastically.

## 4.12 Revision Application Unit

## 4.12.1 Historical Background of Revision Application:

4.12.1.1 Under  the  scheme  operative  till 10.10.1982,  the  appeal  against  the  orders  of Commissioners (then called Collectors), of Customs &amp; Central Excise lay with the Central Board of Excise &amp; Customs (now CBIC). As far as the appeals against the orders passed by the authorities below the rank of the

Collectors (now called Commissioners), were concerned, the same were required to be filed before the appellate Collectors of Customs &amp; Central Excise.

4.12.1.2 The erstwhile Section 131 of the Customs Act, 1962 and Section 36 of the Central Excise &amp; Salt Act, 1944, empowered the Central Government to revise the orders passed by the CBEC and appellate Collectors in  exercise  of  their  appellate  jurisdiction.  At  the Government level, the Secretary (Revenue) or Special Secretary decided upon Revision Applications against orders passed by the CBEC, and the Additional Secretary or Joint Secretary dealt with the applications against the orders passed by the appellate Collectors of Customs &amp; Central Excise and executive Collector of Customs and Central Excise.

4.12.1.3 The Finance (No.2) Act, 1980 introduced a new system by establishing the Appellate Tribunal. The appellate jurisdiction of CBEC and Revisionary jurisdiction of  the  Central  Government  were  abolished  w.e.f. 11.10.1982, except a few residual transitional provisions and the Customs, Excise and Gold Appellate Tribunal (then known as CEGAT, but now commonly known as CESTAT) was set up w.e.f. 11.10.1982.

4.12.1.4 The  Finance  Act,  1984,  revived  the Revisionary  powers  of  the  Central  Government  in specified type of cases. On the Customs side, Section 129DD read with proviso to Section 129(A) of the Act, empowered Central Government to revise the appellate orders  passed  by  the  Commissioner  of  Customs (Appeals). On Central Excise side, Section 35 EE read with first proviso to sub-section (ii) of Section 35B of the Central Excise Act, 1944 gave review and revisionary powers  to  Central  Government  to  revise  the  orders passed by the Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals).

4.12.1.5.1 Since inception there was only one Revision Application  Unit  having  its  office  at  Delhi  which  was headed by the Joint Secretary (Revision Application), Department of Revenue,  New Delhi. The revisionary powers of the Central Government were being exercised by  a  Joint  Secretary,  in  the  Department  of  Revenue, Headquarters (being a technical post under IRS (C &amp; CE), till July, 2017.

4.12.1.5.2 In  March,  2016,  the  Hon'ble  Punjab  and Haryana High Court, in the matter of NVR Forgings vs. Union  of  India  {2016  (335)  ELT  679},  held  that  a revisionary order passed by the Joint Secretary, who is in the same rank as the Commissioner (Appeals), cannot be sustained. This  order  of  the  Hon'ble  Punjab  and Haryana High Court has been upheld by  the  Hon'ble Supreme Court as reported in 2017 (348) ELT A-82. The Hon'ble Madras High Court and Hon'ble Gujarat High Court  have  also  taken  a  similar  view  in  the  matter. Therefore,  the  post  of  Revisionary  Authority  was upgraded.

4.12.1.5.3 Pursuant to the aforesaid judgment of the Hon'ble High Court, sanction of the competent authority was accorded for temporary up-gradation of an existing post of  Joint Secretary and the newly created post of Director  in  Revision Application  Unit,  to  the  level  of Additional  Secretary,  as  technical  posts,  and, consequently, two posts of Principal Commissioner, were reduced from the cadre strength of IRS (C&amp;CE), vide Department of Revenue's Sanction Order No. 160/2017 dated 19.07.2017. Pursuant thereto, one post of AS (RA) each was created at New Delhi and Mumbai, vide the Department of Revenue's Office Order  No.  202/2017 dated 20.07.2017.

4.12.1.5.4 At  present,  there  are  two  Revision Application Units, situated at Delhi and Mumbai which deal with the Revision Applications filed before Central Government in the above specified matters as per the specified  geographical  jurisdiction.  These  Revision Application Units are presently headed by the Principal Commissioner  (Revision Application)  and  ex-officio Additional  Secretary  to  the Government  of India  who consider  and  decide  the  revision  applications  after following the due process of law.

4.12.1.5.5 The work has been distributed between the two Revisionary Authorities on geographical basis i.e., the work relating to North, East  and south Zones are handled in RA-Unit, New Delhi while that relating to West is handled in RA Unit, Mumbai. The arrangement was modified  in  2022  vide  order  No.  191/2022,  dated 28.07.2022, the cases pertaining to the South Zone were reallocated to RA Unit New Delhi with an objective to equitably distribute the pending applications for faster disposal.

## 8. Swachh Bharat Campaign

The  Department  of  Revenue  (DoR)  has successfully conducted the Special Campaign 4.0 in all the offices under it. The Department had set various targets in the 'Preparatory Phase' of Special Campaign 4.0.  In the 'Execution Phase' from 2nd - 31st Oct. 2024, DoR made all out efforts to achieve the targets in all major items of work viz., VIP references, Public Grievances, review &amp; weeding out of files, among others.

All officers in DoR put in extra efforts and ensured 100% achievement of targets during the campaign. The stress was on to institutionalise Swachhta (cleanliness) in workplace and surroundings.

There has been significant progress under the campaign upto 30.10.2024, as detailed below:-

-  1003 Public Grievances out of a target of 1003 Public Grievances have been disposed
-  15 VIP references against the target of 15 VIP references have been disposed
-  315 e-files out of a target of 315 e-files have been closed after review
-  1,646 physical files (100%) have been weeded out after reviewing
-  Old dilapidated furniture/fixtures, other waste/ Scrap items and e-wastes have been disposed of

resulting in freeing up of office space. It has also resulted in earning of Rs. 1,89,100/- as revenue for the department.

In addition of the above, under the 'Ek Ped Maa ke Naam' campaign, DoR planted saplings in DoR and its attached offices.

In  another  big initiative,  e-Court solution  was launched in different Authorities under the Department of Revenue, viz.  Appellate Tribunal (SAFEMA), Adjudicating Authority  (PMLA)  and  Competent  Authority  &amp; Administrator located  at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata.

The implementation of e-courts solution would result in  enhanced efficiency  in case  management procedures, and will enable  paper-less filing, listing, scheduling, hearing and judgement. It will also facilitate parties to  the case  to access  case information,  file petitions and documents electronically and get justice even without any physical attendance in these courts.

It  will also help to achieve a simplified, responsive, effective,  accountable  and  transparent  working  in Government Authorities.

The DoR remains committed to take forward the steps taken during the SCDPM 4.0 throughout the year to ensure efficiency in disposal of work, cleanliness of the office and public premises and making a positive impact on the environment.

## II.    VISION

- (ii) To  bring  in  operational  efficiencies  in  CPSEs through strategic disinvestment, ensuring their greater contribution to the economy.
- (iii) Adopt  a  professional  approach  for  financial management of CPSEs in the national interest and disinvestment aimed at expanding public participation in ownership of CPSEs.

## IV. ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE

He  is  assisted  by  one Additional Secretary, three Joint Secretaries, one Economic Adviser and one Advisor (Cost). The Department functions on the Desk Officer pattern and the assigned work is handled at the levels of Joint Secretary, Director/Deputy Secretary and Under Secretary. The Organizational Structure of the Department is placed at Appendix -I.

## V. CURRENT POLICY ON DISINVESTMENT IN CPSEs

Government implements the policy of disinvestment through  the  minority  stake  sale  and  strategic disinvestment of CPSEs.

## (i) Minority stake sale

Minority stake sale without transfer of management control through are carried out in certain CPSEs through SEBI-approved methods such as Initial Public Offer (IPO), Offer for Sale (OFS), Buyback of shares etc. in order to unlock  value,  promote  public  ownership,  meet  the minimum public shareholding norms of  SEBI and  for ensuring higher degree of accountability. These methods play important role in strengthening the capital market through (i) increasing the float of well performing CPSEs (ii) providing opportunity to retail investors to participate in  an  extended  range  of  stocks  and  bonds  and  (iii) increasing liquidity and depth of the markets.

## (ii) Strategic Disinvestment

'Strategic  Disinvestment' i mplies  entire  or substantial sale of Government shareholding of a CPSE along with transfer of management control. In case of Privatization, which  is  a  sub-set  of  strategic

IV

disinvestments, the Government equity in CPSE and its management control is transferred to a private strategic buyer(s) and in other cases of strategic disinvestment, the Govt. equity is transferred to another CPSE along with control.

The policy on strategic disinvestment is based on the  economic  principle  that  Government  should discontinue in sectors, where competitive markets have come of age and economic potential of such entities may be better discovered in the hands of strategic investor due  to  various  factors  such  as  infusion  of  capital, technological  upgradation  and  efficient  management practices.

Strategic disinvestment of CPSEs was implemented till 2004. However, thereafter, till 2014-15, disinvestment in CPSE was carried out only through limited minority stake sale. Since 2016, the Government has substantially overhauled  the  approach  towards  disinvestment  in CPSEs. The policy  for  strategic  disinvestment  was revived. The Department was renamed as Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) with  effect  from  14th April,  2016. A  comprehensive guideline on 'Capital Restructuring of CPSEs' was laid down  in  May,  2016  for  efficient  management  of Government's investment in CPSEs in areas such as, payment of dividend, buyback of shares, issues of bonus shares and splitting of share.

NITI Aayog was mandated to identify the CPSEs for strategic disinvestment. Till February, 2021 NITI Aayog identified CPSEs for strategic disinvestment based on the criteria of (i) National Security; (ii) Sovereign function at arm's length, and (iii) Market Imperfections and Public Purpose.

The strategic disinvestment process was modified in  2019  to  make  the  process  result-oriented  and expeditious. The  new process  provides for  an  InterMinisterial Group (IMG) chaired by Secretary, DIPAM &amp; Secretary  of Administrative  Ministry  to  drive  entire process, while minimizing redundancy and multiplicity of approvals  to  prevent  dilution  of  bidder's  interest  and performance of the CPSEs. The overall process is also overseen  by the  Independent External  Monitor  (IEM) comprising eminent persons.

New PSE policy

The New Public Sector Enterprise ('PSE') Policy for Atmanirbhar Bharat was approved by Cabinet, on 27th January 2021 and was notified on 4 th  February, 2021. The policy intends to redefine public sector participation in business enterprises and to encourage private sector participation in all sectors in order to achieve the goal of self-reliant India.

Under New Public Sector Enterprise ('PSE') Policy public sector commercial enterprises have been classified as Strategic and Non-Strategic sectors. The following four broad Strategic Sectors have been delineated based on the criteria of national security, energy security, critical infrastructure,  provision  of  financial  services  and availability of important minerals:

-  Atomic Energy, Space and Defense;
-  Transport and Telecommunication;
-  Power, Petroleum, Coal and other minerals; and
-  Banking, Insurance and Financial Services.

In Strategic sectors, bare minimum presence of the existing public sector commercial enterprises at Holding Company level will be retained under Government control. The remaining enterprises in a strategic sector, will be considered for privatization or merger /subsidiarization with another PSE or for closure. PSEs in non-strategic sectors  shall  be  considered  for  privatization,  where feasible, otherwise such enterprises shall be considered for closure.

Approval  of  the  Government  for  strategic disinvestment of a specific PSE shall be taken from time to time, on a case-to-case basis. The timing for specific transactions will however, be contingent, inter alia, on the considerations of appropriate sequencing, sectoral trends, administrative feasibility, investors' interest, etc.

The procedure for Strategic Disinvestment is modified from time to time to make it more result oriented, and to tackle new challenges. Keeping this in view, the Cabinet delegated certain additional powers to the Alternative Mechanism during the  year  2022-23.  Similarly,  the Cabinet  on  18.05.2022  had  given  approval  for empowering the Board of Directors of the Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) to recommend  and undertake  the transactions  for  Disinvestment  (both  strategic disinvestment and minority stake sale) or closure of any of their subsidiaries or units or sale of stake in JVs. It was also approved that based on proposal of Board of CPSE and Administrative Ministry, DIPAM will obtain an 'in-priniciple'  approval  of Alternative  Mechanism. Thereafter,  the  Board  of  CPSEs  can  undertake  the process of disinvestment or closure of subsidiaries/units/ JVs based on DIPAM or DPE guidelines.

Guiding  principles  for  strategic  disinvestment/ Minority Stake sale of subsidiaries/units/sale of stakes in JVs by the holding/parent PSE was issued by DIPAM on 14.09.2022. Guiding principles for closure of subsidiaries/ units by their Holding/Parent Public Sector Enterprises was issued by DPE on 31.10.2022.

## In accordance with the new policy, DIPAM took approval of Alterative Mechanism (AM) on the following proposals during the current FY:

- i. Listing of NTPC Green Energy Limited -DIPAM in  coordination  with  Ministry  of  Power  (MoP) facilitated listing of NTPC Green Energy Limited, which is a subsidiary of NTPC Limited. NTPC Green Energy Limited was listed on 27.11.2024 for approximate deal size of Rs.10,000 crore. NTPC Green Energy Limited has been listed with a Market Cap of more than one trillion rupees. The funds raised in the IPO (fresh issue) will be used  by  the  company  for  undertaking investments in green energy projects.
- ii.

## VI.   VALUE CREATION IN CPSEs

Government has now focused on a holistic approach of  public  asset  management  which  balances  the objectives of value creation and value unlocking in CPSEs to optimize returns for the Government (and the minority stakeholders in listed companies) and disinvestment of CPSEs as per the extant policy (minority stake sale and strategic disinvestment). As a part of this strategy, CPSEs are being driven to create value for itself, its employees, shareholders, and the broader economy. Emphasis has been placed on the following aspects.

- i) Performance enhancement of CPSEs : Several key performance indicators have been included in the annual MOU framework for the CPSEs on which the companies are evaluated. Some of the key performance parameters include CAPEX, Return on net-worth or Return on capital employed, Export and Import as % of revenue, EBIDTA as % of revenue and Asset Turnover Ratio. Market related parameters like Total returns to shareholders for listed CPSEs (based on market cap of CPSE vis a vis Market cap of  sectoral  index,  dividend  payout  as  per  capital management guidelines etc) have also been included in the MOU framework for the listed companies.  This is key to raise the value of these companies in the market.
2. (ii) Focus on Capex : CPSEs are encouraged to take up CAPEX to achieve profitable growth in their business. For  example, CPSEs, put together, undertake  capital investment of more than Rs. 3 lakh crore annually from their own resources without budgetary support. Such a large CAPEX creates growth opportunities and further employment.
3. (iii) Capital Management Guidelines :  These guidelines ensure  consistent  dividend  policy  and  other  Capital Management measures such as Buybacks, Bonus, Stock Split etc. Revised Guidelines on Capital Restructuring of CPSEs have been issued on 18.11.2024 to align policy with market realities and requirements of CPSEs.
4. (iv ) Focus on Communication Strategy of CPSEs : CPSEs are being encouraged to have wider and frequent interactions with other capital market participants. Better communication about business with market participants helps CPSEs to raise funds for their future growth and creation of employment opportunities.
5. (v)  Calibrated  disinvestment  strategy :  Calibrated disinvestment strategy is being followed through listing/ IPO of companies and gradual dilution of minority stake through stock market consistent with interest of minority shareholders.  This  calibrated  strategy  has  enabled CPSEs to improve their efficiency and growth and become important players in the capital market.  The calibrated disinvestment  policy  also  ensures  that  transactions whenever carried out, do not cause disruption in the market and remains aligned to overall market direction. This has led to enhanced value of the CPSEs increasing returns to shareholders.

Focus on value-creation and value unlocking through measures cited above, have seen Market cap and CPSE stocks rise significantly over the last few years, leading to increasing returns investors holding these stocks. Total market cap of listed CPSEs has grown by nearly 3.23x in last three years from Rs 12.10 lakh crore (31.03.2021) to Rs 39.14 lakh crore (21.01.2025). Market cap of GoI equity in listed CPSEs has also increased by 3.23x from Rs 6.91 lakh crore (31.03.2021) to Rs 22.30 lakh crore (21.01.2025) in the last three years.  Similarly, CPSE indices have out-performed the benchmark indices in the stock market during the past 3 years.

| Year        | SENSEX   | BSE CPSE   | Nifty-50   | Nifty CPSE   |
|-------------|----------|------------|------------|--------------|
| Last 1 year | 8.17%    | 22.53%     | 8.80%      | 25.26%       |
| Last 2year  | 28.43%   | 113.65%    | 30.60%     | 117.58%      |
| Last 3 year | 34.14%   | 143.54%    | 36.25%     | 168.97%      |

As on 31.12.2024

## VII.   DISINVESTMENT PERFORMANCE

## A. Minority Stake Sale

## i. Initial Public/Further Offer IPO/FPO

- a) Initial  public  offer  (IPO): When  an  unlisted company makes either a fresh issue of shares or  convertible  securities  or  offers  its  existing shares or convertible securities for sale or both for the first time to the public, it is called an IPO. This  paves  way  for  listing  and  trading  of  the issuer's shares or convertible securities on the Stock Exchanges.
- b) Further  public  offer  (FPO): When an  already listed  company makes either a fresh issue of shares or convertible securities to the public or an offer for sale to the public, it is called an FPO.

Achievements: Since 2014-15, 18 CPSEs (including LICI) have been listed which yielded Rs 51,244.10 crore. During this period, 75.91 lakh retail investors invested an amount of Rs. 16,564.36 crore in IPOs of CPSEs.  An additional  market capitalization  of Rs  7.47 lakh  crore (Market-capitalization calculated based on listing price) was achieved through the new listings. At present, 66 CPSEs are listed (excluding public sector banks and insurance Companies) with a total market cap of Rs. 39.4 lakh crore as on 21.01.2025 The total M-cap of 16 public sector banks and insurance companies are Rs. 24.81 lakh Crore as on 21.01.2025.

## ii. Buyback of shares

Buyback is the repurchase by a company of its shares from the existing shareholders that reduces the number of its shares in the open market.

Companies buy back their shares:

- a) To  increase  the  value  of  shares  held  by promoters.
- b) To eliminate any threats by minority shareholders who may be looking for a controlling stake.
- c) For CPSEs, buyback is a tool for Govt. of India to disinvest the equity held by GoI in CPSEs and to make proper utilization of idle cash left with CPSEs.

As  per  the  Revised  Guidelines  on  Capital Restructuring of CPSEs issued by DIPAM on 18.11.2024, CPSE, whose market price of the share is less than the book value consistently for the last six months, and having net-worth of at least Rs. 3000 crore and cash &amp; bank balance of over Rs. 1500 crore may consider the option to  buy-back  their  shares.  Further,  if  buyback  is  not considered desirable for a CPSE with excess cash, but no committed expenditure, company may consider paying higher or special dividend to the shareholders.

Achievements : In order to make the use of idle cash lying with CPSEs and for improving the Earning per share, Govt. has used buyback method effectively. During the last ten years, disinvestment proceeds of Rs 45,104 crore were realized from buyback of shares by 45 CPSEs.

## iii. Offer for Sale (OFS)

Offer for sale (OFS) is a simpler method of sale of shares  through  the  exchange  platform  for  listed companies. The mechanism was first introduced by SEBI in 2012, to make it easier for promoters of publicly-traded companies to cut  their  holdings  and  comply  with  the minimum public shareholding norms by June 2013. The method was largely adopted by listed companies, both state-run and private, to adhere to the SEBI norms of minimum public shareholding. Government often used this route to divest its shareholding in CPSEs.

## Salient features of OFS:

-  simple to execute
-  market-driven
-  Govt. continues to retain management control
-  Cost-effective

-  Time efficient (completed in 2 trading days)
-  Transparent  allocation  based  on  price-parity basis.

Achievements :  After listing, further disinvestment by OFS mechanism yielded Rs 1,34,771.2 crore through various transactions  in  10+  years  (as  on  21.01.2025).  This included the largest OFS of over Rs. 22,000 crore in case of Coal India Limited in January, 2015.

During F.Y. 2024-25, OFS transactions were carried out in General Insurance Corporation of India Limited (Re), Cochin Shipyard Limited and Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL)  and  Government  realized  Rs.  2345.55  crore, Rs.2015.32 crore and Rs. 3449.18 crore respectively from these transactions.

Qualified  Institutional  Placement  (QIP)  in  Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA ) -  Alternative Mechanism (AM) has approved GOI shareholding in IREDA to be diluted, owing to issue of fresh equity through QIP route, up to an extent of 7% of the  paid-up  equity  of  IREDA.  Presently,  IREDA  has engaged  transaction  intermediaries  such  as  Book Running Lead Managers and Legal Counsel for the purpose of QIP and held kick-off meeting with them. The IRDEA is planning non-deal domestic and international roadshows  with potential  investors  tentatively  during February 2025. Expected post dilution GOI holding % in IREDA shall be 68%. Funds raised in the QIP would go to the company, and not GOI.

## Other Transactions

In F.Y. 2024-25, Government received Rs. 815 crore as remittance from SUUTI.

## Exchange Traded Fund

Through various offers of CPSE-ETF and Bharat-22 ETF,  Govt.  could  realize  disinvestment  proceeds  of Rs.98,949 crore since 2016-17.  However, there is now limited  scope  of  disinvestment  through  existing  ETF window as many underlying Stocks in CPSE-ETF and Bharat-22 ETF have reached close to 51% level of GOI equity or some stocks in the ETF basket are no longer available for disinvestment due to strategic disinvestment or other reasons. Also, there has been concern that large and repeated tranches of Equity ETF were acting as a disincentive  for  investors  in  PSU  stocks  due  to  price overhang. Therefore, Government has now decided to pause employing Equity ETFs as a tool for minority stake sale.

## B. Performance in Strategic Disinvestment

The Government, since 2016, has given 'in-principle' approval for strategic disinvestment of 36 cases of PSEs and/or Subsidiaries/ Units/ Joint Ventures of PSEs/ Bank. Out of  the  36  cases,  33  cases  are  being  handled  by DIPAM and 3 cases are being handled by the respective Administrative Ministry/Department. Out of the 33 cases being  handled  by  DIPAM,  strategic  disinvestment transactions  have  been  completed  in  11  cases  (8 transactions are in CPSE-to-CPSE space while Air India, NINL and FSNL (subsidiary) have been privatized); 5 PSEs are under consideration for closure; 1 case held up  due  to  litigation  and  1  case  is  under  Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) in NCLT and 2 transactions  found  not  feasible.  Out  of  remaining  13 transactions, EoI has  not been  issued or  transactions called off after issuance of EoI/RFP in case of 6 PSEs and 7 transactions are ongoing and are at various stages. The details are given at Annexure-I.

In the current FY , the Strategic Disinvestment of FSNL has been concluded. FSNL is a 100% subsidiary of MSTC Ltd, M/o Steel incorporated on 28.03.1979 to provide steel mill  services.  FSNL  specializes  in  the  recovery  and processing  of  scrap  from  slag  and  refuge  generated during iron and steel making across different steel plants. Alternative  Mechanism  approved  the  highest  bid amounting to Rs. 320 crore of M/s. Konoike Transport Co. Ltd.  for sale of 100% equity shareholding of MSTC Ltd  in  Ferro  Scrap  Nigam  Limited  (FSNL)  along  with transfer  of  management control through  a  two-stage open, competitive bidding process supported by a multilayered consultative decision-making mechanism. The Letter  of  Award  has  been  issued.  Share  Purchase Agreement (SPA) has been signed between M/s. Konoike Transport Co. Ltd, M/s MSTC Ltd and M/s FSNL Ltd. The transaction has been concluded on 21.01.2025 after Strategic Partner, FSNL and MSTC met the condition precedent  and  the  shares  of  FSNL  along  with management control were transferred by MSTC Ltd to M/s. Konoike Transport Co. Ltd.

## C. Disinvestment Targets &amp; achievements

Since 2014-15, an amount of about Rs. 4,36,748 crore  (as  on  21.01.2025)  has  been  realized  as disinvestment  proceeds  using  various  modes/ instruments. This includes  Rs 3,30,049 crore  realized from minority stake sale, and Rs. 69,412 crore realized from strategic disinvestment transactions in 10 CPSEs (Air India &amp; NINL have been privatized and in remaining 8 CPSEs strategic disinvestment was in CPSE to CPSE

space). Amount received from strategic disinvestment (Rs. 69,412 crore) does not include Rs. 12,100 crore and Rs. 320 crores received resectively as Enterprise Value for NINL  and FSNL (Subsidiary) as GoI didn't have any direct  equity  in  these  companies.  Other  transactions yielded Rs. 37,287 crore.

Disinvestment is an ongoing process, and execution/ completion of specific transactions hinges upon market conditions,  domestic  and  global  economic  outlook, geopolitical factors, investor interest and administrative feasibility.

However,  under 'Miscellaneous Capital Receipts - Receipts' at the RE stage it was revised to Rs.30,000 crore, which accounted f or  the  receipts  under  erstwhile  categories  of disinvestment and other capital receipts such as asset monetisation.  There  is  no  specific  estimate  for disinvestment in 2024-25 BE as well.  Rs. 50,000 crore kept under Miscellaneous capital receipts, which includes receipts on account of management of equity investments and public assets through various mechanisms

## VIII. OTHER INITIATIVES

## (i) Launch of Bharat Bond ETF

Bharat Bond ETF comprising of AAA rated CPSEs, was launched  in December  2019 which  was the first instrument of its kind based on high-quality public-sector bonds. Tranche -I  of  Bharat  Bond  ETF  launched  in December, 2019 raised over Rs. 12,400 crore. TrancheII  of  BHARAT  Bond ETF  was launched in July, 2020 raising over Rs. 11,000 crore Tranche III was launched in December, 2021 raising over Rs. 6,200 Cr. The three tranches received huge response from all sections of investors especially retail investors.

After the successful launch of three tranches with an AUM of Rs. 50,000+ Cr., the fourth tranche BBETF 2033 of BHARAT Bond ETF with 10+ years maturing in April 2033 was launched on 2nd December 2022 and ended on 8 th  December 2022. The April 2033 issue of BHARAT Bond ETF was oversubscribed  2.8  times against the base issue size of Rs. 1,000 cr. The total Rs 2800 crore was raised against the base issue size of Rs.1000  crore.  8  CPSE  namely  PFCL, IRFC,  REC, NABARD, HUDCO, NTPC Limited, HPCL, and NPCIL are expected to participate and issue bonds.

Asset Under Management (AUM) for the Bond ETF market has grown to Rs. 59,220 crore (as on December, 2024)) out of which about 98% is accounted for Bharat Bond  ETF  (around  Rs  58,020  crore).  It  provided opportunity  to  retail  investors  to  access  bonds  with smaller amount (as low as Rs 1,000) while helping CPSEs mobilized debt at reduced cost. Based on this model, many Bond-ETFs based on G-Sec, State Development Loans (SDLs) and Corporate Bonds have come to the market.

## (ii) Special National Investment Fund

The proposal  for  tendering  33,61,461  shares  of Scooters India Limited (SIL), held in Special National Investment Fund (SNIF), in the delisting offer of SIL, was approved by the Alternative Mechanism in March,2024 following which, the entire such shares of SIL held in SNIF were tendered on 8 th April, 2024. A sum of Rs. 10.68 crores was received on 2nd May, 2024, as a result this transaction. Scooters India Limited (SIL) was approved for closure in the year 2021 and the company has now been delisted from the stock exchange in 2024.

## (iii) Monetization of Enemy Shares

Cabinet  in  its  meeting  on  8th  November,  2018 approved the procedure and mechanism for disposal of Enemy Shares, which is also being handled by DIPAM. As per the enemy shares provided by CEPI MHA, more than  99.4%  shares  have  been  sold.  As  on  date

(November, 2024) total shares of value of Rs. 2740.81 crore have been sold and the proceeds have come back to GoI.

## IX. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT &amp;DIVIDEND RECEIPTS

## Revised Guidelines on Capital Restructuring of CPSEs

DIPAM has issued Revised Guidelines on Capital Restructuring of CPSEs on 18.11.2024 with the approval of Hon'ble Finance Minister. These Guidelines, brought out after due consultation with all stakeholders, reflect the evolution in the capital market conditions, regulatory and  sectoral  changes,  etc.  Main  objectives  of  the Guidelines are to enhance value of the CPSE and returns for the shareholders, improve performance and efficiency of  CPSEs by  providing  them operational &amp; financial flexibility thereby enabling them to play effective role in economic growth  of  the  country. The  comprehensive Revised  Guidelines  have  been  circulated  to  all Administrative  Ministries/Departments and  CPSEs for compliance.

## Dividends:

Dividends from CPSEs form an important component of non-tax receipts. The work related to dividends was transferred  from  Department  of  Economic Affairs  to DIPAM  from  Financial  Year  2020-21  onwards. Accordingly,  an  Inter-Ministerial  Committee  namely Committee for monitoring of Capital Management and Dividend in CPSEs (CMCDC) for discussing/approving proposals relating to capital management/restructuring and dividend payouts, including exemption proposals of CPSEs has been set up. Consistent Dividend Policy was framed by  DIPAM  (in  November  2020) for  ensuring predictability  in  dividend  payment  by  companies. A predictable dividend regime helps in reviving investor interest and improve market sentiments for CPSE stocks as predictability in regular dividend payment would attract quality investors to CPSE stocks and retain them in the hope  of  a  future  dividend.  Government  will  also  get predictable and periodic dividends as interim dividend. This policy has been successful and as a result, CPSE indices have significantly improved over the last year, beating  the  matching  the  benchmark  Sensex. The significant rise in dividend payouts by CPSEs has also encouraged investors to invest in CPSE stocks. The Government realized  Rs.  59,533  crore  as  dividend payouts by CPSEs for the FY 2022-23. Total dividend receipts from CPSEs in FY 2023-24 stood at Rs 64,029.74 crore, which exceeds the Revised Estimate (RE) of Rs

50,000 crore, and is more than actual dividend receipts (Rs 59,533 crore) during the previous financial year. Sofar, Rs. 49,323 crore (as on 20.01.2025) has been received as dividend from CPSEs.

## X INITIATIVES UNDERTAKEN FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES, SCHEDULED CASTES, SCHEDULED TRIBES AND OTHER BACKWARD CLASSES:

## 4. Developments in Banking Sector

## 4.1 Overall condition of Banking Sector

-  The banking system in India, which evolved over several decades, is well established and has been serving  the  credit  and  banking  needs  of  the economy. The banking ecosystem is providing impetus to economic growth and development of the country and catering to the specific and varied financial requirements of different customers and borrowers.
-  To identify and address the issue of stress which remained  hidden  in  the  form  of  Standard Restructured Assets  (SRAs)  in  the  banking system, RBI initiated Asset Quality Review (AQR) in 2015 under which, after transparent recognition by banks and withdrawal of the special treatment of  restructured loans,  stressed accounts were reclassified as  NPAs and  expected losses  on stressed loans, not provided for earlier as a result of  the  special  treatment,  were  provided  for, resulting in higher NPAs which peaked in 2018. Higher NPA and necessitated provisioning deeply impacted the financial parameters of banks and impeded their ability to grow and lend to productive sectors of the economy.
-  Government's commitment to  reforms  in the financial sector was announced at "Retreat for Banks and Financial Institutions" called "Gyan Sangam"  held  in  2015.  Later  in Aug-2015, Government launched "Indradhanush" scheme for comprehensive framework to revamp and improve financial state of PSBs including capital infusion plan over four years, from FY2015-16 to FY201819.
-  Government implemented a comprehensive 4R's strategy  of  Recognising  NPAs  transparently, Resolution and Recovery, Recapitalising PSBs, and Reforms in the financial system to address the challenges faced by PSBs. The measures taken by the Government/RBI, include, inter alia, the following:

## 1. Credit discipline:

##  Enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has laid down a collective mechanism for resolution of insolvencies in the country by maintaining a delicate balance for all stakeholders to preserve the economic value of the entities and to complete the process in a time bound manner. It has:

-  Empowered creditors of a Corporate Debtor;
-  Led to behavioural change in the debtorcreditor relationship by shifting the focus from the 'Debtor in Possession' to a 'Creditor in Control' regime.

##  Setting  up  of  the  Central  Repository  of Information on Large Credits

Setting up of the Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) by RBI:

-  To collects, stores and disseminates credit data to lenders; and
-  Banks are required to submit report on weekly basis to CRILC, in case of any default by borrowing entities with exposure of ?5 crore and above.

##  Systematic checking of high-value accounts for wilful default and fraud.

2. Recognition and resolution of stress: To protect financial institutions in case of default or payment delay by large borrowers, RBI/Government has taken multiple steps which include, inter alia, the following:

##  Principle-based framework has been put in place for early recognition and time-bound resolution

A comprehensive principle-based framework has been put in place for early recognition and timebound  resolution  of  stress  in  the  borrower accounts,  manifesting  in  payment  default. Delayed resolution is disincentivised under the framework  as  lenders  are  required  to  make additional provisioning in case of resolution plans are not implemented within specified timeline.

##  Securitisation  and  Reconstruction  of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002

Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act) has been amended and it was provided for the District Magistrate / Chief Metropolitan Magistrate to pass orders for the purpose  of  taking  possession  of  the  secured assets by lenders within a period of thirty days from the date of application;

##  The Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993

The Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act,1993 has been amended with the provision for three months imprisonment in case the borrower does not provide details of property/assets other than those properties/assets specified by the lender while filing the application to the DRT;

##  Debt Recovery Tribunal

Jurisdiction of Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRTs) was increased from ` 10 lakh to ` 20 lakh to enable the DRTs to focus on high value cases;

##  Proactively detection of stress

To proactively detect stress and reduce slippage into  NPAs,  following  measures  have  been implemented:

-  Automated Early Warning Systems (EWS) in banks;
-  Use of third-party data; and
-  Workflow focussing on time-bound remedial actions.

##  Regulatory framework for Asset Reconstruction Companies

Regulatory framework for Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) has been amended with an objective of:

-  Strengthening  transparency  in  the  ARC sector; and
-  Improving corporate governance standards in ARCs.

##  Better management of the credit risk

Market  based  mechanisms  have  been strengthened to enable the financial institutions to better manage the credit risk on their balance sheets through a comprehensive framework for transfer of stressed assets to eligible transferees.

## 3. Enhanced Access &amp; Service Excellence (EASE)

Through EASE framework, an objective process of incremental reforms in sync with the evolving ecosystem has  been  institutionalizedsss  across  PSBs.  EASE Reforms Agenda, deeply ingrained in PSBs and a key priority for bank leadership, provides a common agenda accounting for requirements of all banks and reflects the industry priorities from short- and long-term perspectives.

Areas of continued focus include - Governance, prudential lending, risk management, technology and data-driven banking and outcome-centric HR.

## 4. Governance in PSBs

Governance in PSBs has been strengthened through:

-  arm's length selection of top management through FSIB;
-  introduction  of  non-executive  chairmen  in nationalised banks;
-  widening talent pool and instituting performancebased extensions for MD;
-  instituting appraisal by Boards of top management and NODs;
-  widening the pool of eligible WTDs by including private sector executives for appointment of MD &amp; CEO in large PSBs; and
-  recruitment of CXOs viz., Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Economist from the market.

## 5. Consolidation of PSBs

With consolidation of banks, the efficacy of the banking sector has been enhanced by leveraging economies of scale  and  synergies.  The  consolidation  exercise  has resulted in marked improvement in the financials and governance in these banks. Profits of PSBs have reached all time high and they continue to expand their reach to every nook and corner of the country. Their capital base has strengthened and their asset quality has improved. Banks are now raising capital from the market instead of depending upon the Government for recapitalization.

## 6. National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd.

National Asset Reconstruction Company  Limited (NARCL) and Asset Management Company (IDRCL) have been set up to consolidate and take over the existing stressed debt and then manage and resolve the accounts by implementation of various resolution strategies including disposing of the assets to Alternate Investment Funds and other potential investors for eventual value realization. NARCL has enabled transfer of bad debts of the banks from their balance sheets to the former, and has also enabled freeing  up  human  resources  from recovery functions, for productive business development, including credit deployment.

4.2. Important decisions / Initiatives taken

- a) Review of guidelines on the number of posts of Chief  General  managers  (CGMs)  /  General Managers (GMs) / Deputy General Managers (DGM)s / Assistant General Managers (AGMs)

Status as on last year: With a view to make the span  of  control  more  manageable  and  effective, Government in  the  year  2019  had  conveyed  'no objection' to introduce Chief General Manager (CGM) post, below board level, in those Nationalised Banks (NBs) having a total business of Rs. 10 Lakh crore or higher. Accordingly, CGM post was available in six out of eleven Nationalized Banks. The remaining banks have been approaching the Government for making available the CGM post in their banks also. There was also a demand from all the NBs to review existing methodology for fixing the number of executives citing various reasons such as high pace of digitalization, the growing role of specialized and dedicated verticals, branch expansion etc. The number of executives from the  post  of AGM  to  CGM,  were  5800  across  all nationalised banks.

Present Status: The Finance Minister, in the year 2024, has approved the  creation of CGM post in remaining  five  nationalized  banks  (i.e.)  Bank  of Maharashtra, Central Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, Punjab &amp; Sind Bank and UCO Bank. While creating the said post, the Finance Minister has also approved the increase in the existing number of CGMs in the banks that already have CGM level posts. This step  will  significantly  enhance  the  administrative structure and efficiency of banks.

CGM post acts as an administrative and functional layer between the General Manager (GM) and the Executive  Director  (board  level  post)  in  the Nationalized Banks. The increase of CGM posts will enhance the capability of banks to better monitor critical positions such as digitalisation, cyber security, fin-tech,  risk,  compliance,  rural banking,  financial inclusion etc., and sub-domains like retail Credit,  Agricredit, MSME Credit etc., thereby leading to more targeted strategies and improved overall performance. Increase in the number of CGMs will further enable the banks to have a better control and supervision thereby resulting in improved asset management and operational efficiency.

The number of posts has been revised based on the business mix of the banks as on 31.03.2023, with the ratio of one CGM for every four GMs. This creation / increase will not only benefit the GMs elevating to the post of CGM but also benefit the immediate lower levels of executives, below GM level posts i.e. Deputy General Managers (DGM) and Assistant General Managers (AGM), as with the increase of 01 CGM level post, there will be an increase in 04 GM posts, 12 DGM posts and 36 AGM posts.

With the revision, the number of CGM posts in all the 11 Nationalised Banks has been increased from 80 to 144. Accordingly, the number of GM posts has been revised from 440 to 576, the number of DGM posts from 1320 to 1728 and the number of AGM posts

from 3960 to 5184. Post enhancement at the senior management level will lead to increased oversight and will result in better identification and mitigation of risks, especially in complex financial environments.

This significant step has been taken keeping in view the demands being received from various banks and also due to the substantial growth in business, verticals, domains and branch expansions of the banks that require a dedicated pyramid of executives at the senior level

- b) Revision in the ceiling on the Staff Welfare Fund in Public Sector Banks (PSBs) Staff welfare fund (SWF) is a fund allocated by the PSBs for the welfarerelated activities (health-related expenses, subsidies on canteen, sports and cultural activities, educationrelated financial assistance etc.) in respect of working and retired officials of PSBs. SWF was given a fillip by increasing the maximum ceiling of annual spending.

Status as on last year: PSB were using the SWF ceiling as per the revision made in year 2012. Post amalgamation in  2019/2020,  PSBs  were  using  combined  ceiling  of amalgamated banks. The combined maximum annual expenditure ceiling of SWF for all PSBs was Rs 540 Crore. The ceiling on SWF was ranging earlier from Rs. 15 Cr to 150 Cr. among PSBs.

Present Status: The ceiling on SWF has been thoroughly revised in the year 2024, after taking into consideration the number of employees and retirees in PSBs as of 2024 and the change in the business mix of the PSBs. PSBs were categorized into four different slabs based on their business mix and the employee strength and the combined maximum annual expenditure ceiling of SWF for all the 12 PSBs has increased from Rs.540 crore to Rs.845 crore. This increase will benefit 15 lakh staff including the retired employees of all the 12 PSBs. A graphical presentation in this regard is as under:

This measure reflects the Government's commitment to support the welfare of both current employees and retirees of PSBs, recognising the rising cost of welfare services and the expanded workforce following recent mergers. These welfare initiatives shall boost the workforce morale and help create a supportive environment, essential for continued growth in India's banking sector.

- c) Revision of Crisis Management Plan (CMP) The CMP, first formulated in the year 2019 and modified subsequently in  the  year  2021,  is  invoked  for  an industry-wide strike in Banking Industry for three or more  days.  It  involves  proactive  preparation, communication,  and  coordination  to  minimize disruption,  ensure  stakeholder  safety  and  restore operations swiftly. Based on the observation of the Secretary (Security),  Cabinet  Secretariat  and  the suggestions of the stakeholders, the CMP has been revisited and revised CMP-2024 has been circulated to  all  PSBs  to  make  their  Standard  Operating Procedures (SOP) in  line with  CMP-2024 of  this Department.

Highlights on new inclusions in CMP-2024 : The highlights of the modifications done in the CMP - 2024 are as under:

- i. Inclusion of Crisis Information Flowchart as per the GOI guidelines;
- ii. Clarification on the role of Crisis Management Group;
- iii. Defined composition, role and responsibilities of 'Monitoring Committee' and 'Crisis Management Team';
4. i v . Inclusion of a Scheduled Commercial Bank other than PSBs in the Steering Committee;
5. v . Provision for background checking, vetting of integrity, physical security plan and mock drill in banks;
- vi. Coordination of SLBCs and LDMs with the Local Administration to  maintain law &amp; order during strike;
- vii. Defining role of banks based on their geographical position;
- viii. Mitigating the Crisis by ensuring full functioning of  Critical  Infrastructure like Currency Chests, Cheque Clearing Processing Centres (CCPCs), Data Centres, Data Recovery Centres, Treasury Operations etc.

The CMP 2024 provides a comprehensive framework for  handling  potential  industry-wide  strikes  in  the banking  sector,  ensuring  minimal  disruption  to services. It establishes Crisis Management Teams at multiple level and a coordination framework among them, enabling banks to prepare for strike situation, mitigate operational vulnerability during strikes and sustain core operations including critical infrastructure like ATMs and data centres.

The CMP ensures that customers are also informed about strike timelines and have access to essential services through alternative channels such as mobile &amp; internet banking. This comprehensive approach helps maintain trust, enabling banks to uphold stability and protect customer interests during potential crises.

## d) Performance  Linked  Incentive  Scheme  for Whole-time Directors and senior executives in PSBs:

## Status as per last year:

Earlier Performance Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme was introduced to suitably reward and motivate WholeTime Directors (WTDs) of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) only. The eligibility for PLIs for the WTDs of the PSBs was  evaluated on  the  basis  of  Key  Performance Indicators (KPI) approved by the Finance Minister. The maximum amount of PLI payable to Managing Director &amp; Chief Executive Officer was Rs. 8 Lakh and to Executive Director was Rs. 6.5 Lakh. This Scheme was not applicable to other officers of the banks.

The increasing presence, dominance and swift ability to embrace system-driven changes by other players in  the  market  like  Private  Sector  Banks,  Foreign Banks, Payment Banks, Small Finance Banks and other  financial  sector  participants  such  as  NonBanking Financial Institutions (NBFCs) and other FIs have changed the scope of banking in multitudes and are forcing the PSBs to evolve beyond traditional banking.  These changes are required to be aptly recognized  and  accordingly  the  compensation package, scheme coverage and KPIs with its evaluation matrix are required to be revised to reflect present market position.

## Current Status:

Accordingly, Finance Minister has approved a revised Scheme for Performance Linked Incentive with the objective to suitably reward and motivate WTDs of PSBs. Further, for greater inclusivity, the revised PLI Scheme has  been  made  applicable  to  senior executives from Scale-IV to Scale - VIII (i.e. Chief Manager to Chief General Manager) duly recognising the leadership role played by them in efficient steering of the bank's performance.

## Department of Financial Services V

The revised PLI Scheme shall evaluate performance on detailed Evaluation Matrix comprising of four equally weighted Evaluation Parameters - (i) Efficiency, (ii) Business, (iii)  Asset Quality and (iv) Financial Inclusion (including EASE reforms). The first three parameters are  further  divided  into  12  sub-parameters.  The performance evaluation on these sub-parameters shall be made using different Evaluation Methodologies such as  comparing  performance  with  previous  year's performance of the bank, comparing performance with average performance of Scheduled Commercial Bank and Public Sector Banks and performance in respect of allocated targets. Further, under parameter (iv), performance of all the PSBs are assessed on the basis of achievement of targets for flagship schemes for financial inclusion.

Under the revised PLI Scheme, the maximum amount of incentive for WTDs has been increased to their annual basic pay. Similar provision,  with  suitable modification, has been made for senior executives in the scale-IV to scale - VIII. The revised Scheme will foster  a  sense  of  accomplishment,  encourage continuous learning and innovation and  promote competitive  atmospheres  that  will  boost  the productivity. The Scheme is effective from FY 202324.

## 4.3. Regional Rural Banks

The Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) were established under the RRBs Act, 1976 to create an alternative channel for credit dispensation to small and marginal farmers,  agricultural  laborers,  socio-economically weaker section  of  population  for  development  of agriculture, trade, commerce, small scale industry and other productive activities in rural areas. As on 31 March 2024, 43 RRBs are operating through a network of 22,069 branches in 26 States and 3 Union Territories (Puducherry, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Ladakh) covering 700 districts of the country. The RRBs are jointly owned by  the  Central  Government,  the  concerned  State Government and the Sponsor Banks with shareholding in the ratio of 50:15:35 respectively.

## 4.3.1. Role of RRBs:

RRBs have a mandate to ensure rural development and foster financial inclusion. The contributions being made by RRBs as a whole at present, are briefly as under:

- (i) Of the total loans extended by RRBs, as on 31st March 2024, over 87% of loans are extended to the  priority  sector,  and  about  67%  is  towards agriculture sector. Of the total loans, about 61% of are extended to weaker sections of the society.
- (ii) RRBs play a significant role in extending micro credit. They account for 31% of the SHG loan accounts and 25% of the total loan amount is extended to SHGs. Nearly 19% of the total KCCs have been issued by the RRBs.
- (iii) Share of RRBs in total accounts/enrollments under Government Sponsored Schemes like PMJDY, PMJJBY, PMSBY, APY, etc. varies from 15% to 20%.

## 4.3.2. Recapitalization Scheme:

The Government of India along with other stakeholders of RRBs viz concerned state government and sponsor banks  recapitalise  them  to  help  RRBs  meet  the regulatory requirement of 9% CRAR (Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio). Infusion of capital in RRBs is done with an aim to rejuvenate and revitalise the RRBs with  sufficient  growth  capital  to  facilitate

- (iv) 92% of the branches of RRBs are in rural and semi urban areas. RRBs have a share of 29% in the number of rural bank branches. In the rural areas of aspirational districts, RRBs have about 40% of the bank branches. Moreover, many RRBs have branches in remote areas  and they are providing financial services to vulnerable sections.
- ( v) In rural areas, the share of deposit accounts of RRBs is about 25% and RRBs have the highest average balance in PMJDY accounts amongst all categories  of  banks.  In  North-eastern  region, RRBs cater to the banking needs of about 38% of the rural people.  As against the overall rural CD Ratio of 70% for all the Scheduled Commercial Banks, RRBs had a rural CD Ratio of 79% as on 31 March 2024. As a result of a healthy credit growth of RRBs during the previous 3 years, the consolidated CD ratio of RRBs improved to 71.4 % as on 31 March 2024, which was the highest CD Ratio in over 33 years.

reinventing themselves as sustainably viable and selfsufficient financial institutions and for leading  the growth process and the change in rural areas. The capital  infusion  is  to  help  RRBs  in  technology adoption and  to  efficiently  cater  to  the  financial inclusion needs of the rural populace.

Further, the recapitalisation scheme is accompanied by operational and governance reforms under the broad

ambit of Sustainable Viability Plan (SVP) with a welldefined implementation mechanism aimed at credit expansion, business diversification, NPA reduction, cost rationalisation, technology adoption, improvement in corporate governance etc.

## 4.3.3. Progress &amp; Outcome:

- i) The last recapitalization support was provided to RRBs as a one-time upfront recapitalisation of Rs.5,445 crore as  GoI  share,  approved  by  Expenditure  Finance Committee (EFC) in its meeting held on 11.10.2021, 75% of which i.e. Rs.4,084 crore was infused into the RRBs during the FY 2021-22. The balance 25% of recapitalisation support of Rs.1,361 crore as GoI share was to be infused during the year 2022-23, upon demonstrable improvement in the operational and governance reforms as per the Viability Plan.
2. ii) Accordingly,  each  RRB prepared  a  3-year  Board approved Viability Plan in FY 2022-23 encompassing

operational  and  governance  reforms.  The  RRBs demonstrated  a  significant  improvement  in  key financial indicators under the viability plan. Therefore, the balance amount of Rs.1,361 crore was infused into the RRBs during the FY 2023-24 and 2024-25.

- iii) In  this  backdrop,  the  performance  of  RRBs  has improved significantly during FY 2023-24 and has reached historic highs on several parameters. RRBs posted highest ever consolidated net profit of ` 7,571 crore during FY 2023-24 and their consolidated CRAR was at an all-time high of 14.2% as on 31 March 2024. The asset quality measured by GNPA (Gross NonPerforming Assets) at 6.1% was the lowest in previous 10 years.  Credit  expansion  led  to  an  increase  in consolidated CD ratio to 71.4%, which was the highest in over 33 years. The pace of technology adoption has increased as more RRBs have started rolling out digital services to their customers.

## 16. Debt Recovery Tribunals(DRTs)/Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunals(DRATs)

## 16.1 Revamped e-auction portal

In 2018, Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance, suggested to create an e-Auction platform to capture  and  display  complete  details  of  properties mortgaged to banks which are to be auctioned under SARFAESI Act and to boost the sale value realized through bank e-auctions.

A common web portal https://ibapi.in (Indian Banks Auction Properties Information) after due testing by the member PSU banks was developed by Indian Bank (erstwhile Allahabad Bank). Subsequently MSTC Ltd., a PSU under the  Ministry of Steel,  was shortlisted  for conducting  property  e-auctions  with  an  integrated  epayment facility. The common e-auction platform for PSBs went live in December 2019 under the name of "e-Bikray". After consideration of challenges and concerns i.e. ease of transacting, enhancing the user experience, expanding the  reach  of  the  portal  represented  by  Banks,  it  was decided to launch a revamped e-auction portal. In order to ensure that listing and auction of properties take place in a seamless manner, the revamped e-auction platform has been made operational as per the latest standards in the industry. This will result into increase in the pool of potential buyers and hence higher recoveries for banks. The portal has now been launched.

## 2. Organisation and Autonomy of CPSEs

The endeavour of the Government is to make Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) autonomous Board  managed  companies.  Under  Articles  of Association,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  CPSEs  enjoys autonomy in respect of recruitment, promotion and other service conditions of below board level employees. The Board of Directors of a CPSE exercises delegated powers subject to broad policy guidelines issued by Government from time to time.

## 2.1 Structure of Boards of CPSEs:

The  Board  of  Directors  of  CPSEs  essentially consist of three types of Directors namely Government Directors, Functional Directors and Independent (NonOfficial)  Directors.  The  Boards  are  headed  by  a Chairperson cum Managing Director. As per the extant guidelines the number of functional Directors should not exceed 50% of the actual strength of the Board and the number of  Government  nominee  Directors  shall  be restricted to a maximum of two. In case of listed CPSEs with executive Chairperson, the number of non-official Directors shall be at least 50% of the Board strength. In case of unlisted and listed CPSEs with non-executive Chairperson, at least one-third of the Board Members shall be non-official Directors.

## 2.1.1 Chairperson cum Managing Director:

Appointment of CMD on the Board of CPSE is made by the concerned administrative Ministry on the basis of recommendations of Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) after obtaining approval  of  competent authority  and  after  completing  due  formalities  in  this regard.

## 2.1.2 Government Directors:

The Government Directors are generally senior officers of the Government of India, State Government(s) or other Government agencies who are nominated to the Boards of CPSEs by the concerned administrative Ministries in ex-officio capacity. The dual role of a Government Director is clearly demarcated i.e. as a director of the company and representative of the Government. As Director of the company, they are bound to exercise due diligence and act in the best interest of the company keeping in view the provisions of the Companies Act 2013. Government being the major shareholder in CPSEs, they are also required to protect its interest.  In doing so, they can take formal instructions from the Government on critical issues and voice  them  in  the  meetings  of  the  Board  of  the company.

## 3. Wage Policy and Manpower Rationalization

The  Department of  Public Enterprises (DPE) functions as the nodal Department for policy relating to pay revision of CPSE executives at Board as well as below Board level and non-unionized supervisors. DPE also issues guidelines for wage settlement negotiations in case of workmen in CPSEs. The Department renders advice to the Administrative Ministries/ Departments and CPSEs in matters relating to revision in pay scales of executives and also for the wage policy negotiations of workmen. The CPSEs are largely following the Industrial Dearness Allowance  (IDA) pattern  of  scales  of  pay. However, in some CPSEs, Central Dearness Allowance (CDA) pattern of scales of pay is also followed.  DPE issues quarterly DA orders in respect of IDA employees. The DA orders for CDA employees of CPSEs are issued for six monthly period.

## 3.1 Pay Revision for employees of CPSEs:

## 3.1.1 Pay  Revision  for  Executives  and  NonUnionised Supervisors  of  IDA  pattern  in CPSEs:

- (i) The third Pay Revision Committee (PRC) was constituted under the Chairmanship of Justice (Rtd.)  Shri  Satish  Chandra  to  consider  and recommend pay scales for Board and Below Board  level  executives  and  non-unionized supervisors of CPSEs under IDA pattern of pay scale. Based on the recommendations of the third PRC and Government's decisions thereon, the

revised  pay  scale  guidelines  effective  from 1st January, 2017 were issued vide DPE OMs dated 03.08.2017, 04.08.2017 and 07.09.2017.

(ii) The  revised  pay  scales  and  allowances recommended by third PRC were based on the basic premise of affordability. These pay scales and allowances would be implemented subject to the condition that the additional financial impact in  the  year  of  implementing  the  revised  paypackage  for  Board  and  Below  Board  level Executives  and  Non-Unionized  Supervisors should not be more than 20% of the Average Profit Before Tax (PBT) of the last three financial years preceding the year of implementation. All the expenditure on this account will be met by the CPSE implementing the revised pay scales &amp; allowances and no budgetary support shall be provided by the government.

## 3.1.2 Pay Revision for employees of CDA pattern in CPSEs:

For the employees of CPSEs following the CDA pattern, DPE vide OM dated 17.08.2017 issued guidelines for  revision  of  pay  scales  and  allowances  w.e.f. 01.01.2016. The benefit of pay revision is allowed to the employees of those CPSEs that are not loss making and are in a position to absorb the expenditure on account of pay  revision  from  their  own  resources  without  any budgetary support from the Government. Further, DPE vide OMs dated 21.05.2018 and 04.07.2019 conveyed the Government decision on allowances applicable to CDA employees of CPSEs.

## 3.1.3 Wage Revision  for  Workmen  under  IDA pattern in CPSEs:

3.2.2.    DPE  has  issued  'Consolidated  &amp;  revised Guidelines regarding Vigilance Policy for CPSEs' O.M. dated 29 th July, 2024.

## 4. Categorization of CPSEs

4.1 The Public Sector Enterprises are categorized into  four  Schedules  namely  'A',  'B',  'C'  &amp;  'D'.  The categorization  of  CPSEs  has  implications  mainly  for organizational  structure  and  salary  of  Board  level incumbents of the concerned CPSE. It also plays a role in  grant  of  autonomy  to  the  Boards  of  CPSEs  under 'Ratna' scheme.

4.2 The initial categorization of CPSEs in the midsixties was made on the basis of their importance to the economy and complexities of their problems. Over the years the Department of Public Enterprises has evolved norms for the purpose of categorization/re-categorization of CPSEs. Categorization is based on both quantitative factors like investment, capital employed, net sales, profit before  tax,  number  of  employees  and  units,  capacity addition, revenue per employee, sales/capital employed, capacity  utilization,  value  added  per  employee  and qualitative  factors  such  as  national  importance, complexities of problems being faced by the company, level  of  technology,  prospects  for  expansion  and diversification of activities and competition from other sectors etc. The other factors, wherever available, relate to  share  price,  MoU  ratings,  Maharatna/Navratna/ Miniratna status and ISO certification. In addition, the factor relating to the critical/Strategic importance of the CPSE is also taken into account. At present there are 77 Schedule 'A', 65 Schedule 'B', 46 Schedule 'C' and 6  Schedule 'D'  CPSEs. The  Schedule-wise  list  of CPSEs is given in Annexure-6.

## 4.3 Procedure for Categorization:

Proposal for categorization of a CPSE is initiated by the concerned Administrative Ministry/Department and submitted to DPE. The latter examines such proposals and issue orders with the approval of Finance Minister. Further,  to  make  the  process  of  grant  of  initial categorisation to CPSE simple and easy, DPE has issued guidelines on 11.12.2023 as per which all asset holding CPSEs created for managing the non-core assets of the CPSEs under disinvestment and those CPSEs which are yet to be made functional will   be categorized as schedule 'C' as per procedure prescribed in the OM. Later, vide OM dated 20.05.2024 and dated 08.08.2024, the process of categorisation was further simplified. DPE OM dated 20.05.2024 simplified the process for upgradation of the existing categorisation of CPSEs and states that all initially categorized CPSEs would continue to come to DPE for upgradation of their schedule with the approval of their Administrative Ministry/Department. The latter examines such proposals and issue orders with the approval of Finance Minister. Such proposals would not be referred to  PESB  and  Cabinet  Secretariat.  DPE  OM  dated 08.08.2024 simplified the process for initial categorisation of the existing uncategorised functional CPSEs and states that all initially categorized CPSEs would continue to come

to DPE for upgradation of their schedule with the approval of  their Administrative Ministry/Department. The latter examines  such proposals and  issue  orders  with the approval of Finance Minister. Such proposals would not be referred to PESB and Cabinet Secretariat.

## 5. Monitoring &amp; Evaluation

## 5.1 Memorandum of Understanding:

A  Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is a negotiated agreement signed between the Administrative Ministry/ Department and the management of the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). Under this, the CPSE undertakes to achieve targets set in the MoU. In the MoU evaluation, the performance of CPSE on predetermined parameters is compared with the prescribed targets. The MoU serves as a tool for ensuring accountability of the enterprise's management to the government.

## 5.1.1 Scope :

All CPSEs (holding as well as subsidiaries) are required to sign a MoU. The holding CPSEs sign the MoU with their Administrative Ministries/ Departments, while the  subsidiaries  sign  it  with  their  respective  holding companies.

## 5.1.2 Institutional arrangements for Implementation of MoU Policy:

- a) High Powered Committee (HPC) :  The HighPowered Committee is the Apex body for the MoU mechanism for laying policy  guidelines. HPC is headed by the (i) Cabinet Secretary and comprises: (ii) CEO (NITI Aayog), (iii) Finance Secretary,  (iv)  Secretary  (Expenditure),  (v) Secretary (Statistics and Programme Implementation),  (vi)  Chairman  (Public Enterprises  Selection  Board),  (vii)  Chief Economic Advisor (Economic Affairs) and (viii) Secretary (PE) as the members.
- b) Inter-Ministerial  Committee (IMC): The  IMC finalizes the sectoral templates and CPSE-wise MoU parameters. The  purpose  of  sectoral templates is to select and identify the parameters and  their  weightages  relevant  to  the  core business activities relating to a sector and/or the CPSE. The IMC also sets the requisite levels of performance against each of the parameters, so decided,  as  benchmarked  targets. The  IMC comprises: (i) Secretary (PE) as the Chairman and representative of (ii) Chief Economic Advisor (Economic Affairs), (iii) D/o Expenditure, (iv) M/ o Statistics and Programme Implementation, (v) NITI Aayog as the members, and (vi) Secretary/ representative of the Administrative Ministry as special invitee, and any other expert co-opted on need basis.

5.1.3 MoU  Framework  (for  the  year  2021-22 onwards): Based on the recommendations of the HPC, the  framework  for  MoU  mechanism using  an  online dashboard  for  the  target  setting  and  performance evaluation of CPSEs has been put in place and made applicable  from  the  year  2021-22.  The  parameters included  in  the  revised  MoU  mechanism  are  market oriented, reflecting shareholders' interest in term of growth in revenue, EBITDA margin, return on net worth, return on capital employed, asset turnover ratio, and market capitalization. Adequate weightage has also been given to production linked parameters pertaining to CPSE's core operations. All  the  parameters  are  quantifiable  and verifiable from the documents available in public domain. Besides, certain  government's  priorities/  programmes such as procurement from MSEs, CSR etc. have also been  included  for  compliance  by  CPSEs,  the  noncompliance of which would result in deduction of marks.

The revised MoU framework also provides for benchmarking based on growth and emerging trends of the sector, vision that has been worked by the Ministry about the sector, and peer performance.

5.1.4 MoU Score and Rating: The  CPSEs will  be allotted marks proportionately for achievement of target figure for each parameter. Score on all parameters would be added to arrive at MoU score. The rating system of CPSEs based on the MoU score is as follows:

| Aggregated Score   | Rating    |
|--------------------|-----------|
| 90 ≤ Score         | Excellent |
| 70 ≤ Score < 90    | Very Good |
| 50 ≤ Score < 70    | Good      |
| 33 ≤ Score < 50    | Fair      |
| Score < 33         | Poor      |
