Issues Faced

PDF Text Extraction
Some PDFs had inconsistent formatting (e.g., broken words, extra spaces).
I resolved this by using pdfplumber instead of basic PyPDF2 since it preserved structure better.

NER Model Performance
The pretrained model (dslim/bert-base-NER) sometimes misclassified organization names as miscellaneous entities.
I kept the default model without fine-tuning to keep the task simple, but noted the limitation.

Visualization with displaCy
For large texts, displaCy visualization was hard to scroll. I solved this by testing on smaller text chunks.

JSONL Output
Initially, I was saving JSON instead of JSONL (multiple JSON objects line by line).
Fixed it by writing each entity dictionary with json.dumps() followed by a newline.
